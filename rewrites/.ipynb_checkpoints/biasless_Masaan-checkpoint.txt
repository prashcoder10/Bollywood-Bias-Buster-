It’s a new building-

The railway platform (no. 1) is one side and the 
other side is the reception area of the station.
A small hand-

A peon is cleaning the floor and she’s the first in the 
office.
Devi looks at the desktop computers covered in 
packaging-plastic and bubble-wraps.
PEON

Abandoned lamps, old registers, 
two railway-station benches, and sign-boards lying in the

The gate opens into a hall where ticket counters 
are.
She enters the office and finds another man, SADHYA JI (36)

Ae Deepakwa...tumhaari bhi nikal

Deepak is lost in his thoughts.
He looks up at the house 
where his mother and bhabhi are sitting outside, looking at 
the ganges.
The ghat is quiet.
Couple of workers in the distance laying

DOCTOR (CONT’D)
(heavily drunk)
Tumhare Sanjay mama ek baar ek 
nabbe saal ki budhiya ka shav jala 
rahe they.
Budhiya ke paas sone ka 
daant tha.
Parivar walon ne bola 
nikalo isey.
To Sanjay mama gaye, 
hathoda pel diye mooh mein.
Jhatke

Saala daant 
nahin nikla.
6 mahine baad budhiya 
phir mari...phir uska laash 
aaya...Sanjay bola - nikaalein 
daant?
Aur ghar waale boley - nahin 
bhai..mat nikaalo...amma ko aur na 
jhel paayenge!
Everybody laughs.
Deepak is silent.
DOCTOR (CONT’D)
Aisa tamasha roj-roj jhel paoge tum 
bhosdi wale?
He starts belching and feeling dizzy.
Deepak makes him sit 
upright.
Deepak looks into his welling eyes.
He breaks down.
Deepak holds him.
He makes him lie down on 
the ghaat.
DOCTOR (CONT’D)
Kya kiye tum padh likh ke?
Aur kya 
kiya Sikandar ghaat pe rah ke?
DOCTOR (CONT’D)
Sikandar ki umar ke they...tab hum 
bhi sochte they bhaag jaayein...
thoda jee lein.. kabhi nahin bhaag 
paaye.
Aur tumko padhaaye..
ki bhaag 
sako...aur tum yahin mara rahe 
ho...kaahe?
Bhaago bhosdiwale, 
jaao...
jaao yahan se.. Jaao, yahan 
kuch nahin hai murdon ke beech 
mein, jaao madarchod..
He starts crying and slapping Deepak.
Deepak just takes it, 
without resisting.
Doctor gets up and walks away.
Deepak 
comes to the edge of the ghat.
The sound of ‘Raam naam satya 
hai’ starts ringing in his ears.
He takes a look at the ring, 
wrapped in Facebook page, looks at Shaalu’s picture, becomes 
overwhelmed, and throws the ring and the paper in the river. 
But instantly realizes what he has done and jumps in to try 
and find it.
Struggles for a bit in the dark and then keeps on swimming.
Reaches the other end of the river, the small island in the 
middle of Ganga, and looks back at the ghaats he jumped from.
94

Everything looks distant, small, less intimidating from here.
He could spot his father, the burning pyres, the faint light 
coming out of his house, but nothing is affecting him.
He 
sits down there, staring at the river and the life at the 
other end.

PATHAK hands over the money to VIKRAM.
VIKRAM throws the

The kids dive.
The kids come up for breath every 30-40 seconds.
Every time 
Jhonta comes with his mouth filled with coins and drops them 
on the ghaat, PATHAK pushes him back on.
Jhonta is irritated 
by PATHAK’s desperation.
People screaming names of kids.
Inside kids are working harder and faster than ever before.
The ghaat comes alive with loud noises like a boxing match as 
the time gets over.
VIKRAM blows a loud whistle and all the 
boys come out one by one.
VIKRAM starts calling Jhonta’s name but no response.
VIKRAM 
dives in and finds him unconscious.
Brings him out and there 
is commotion.

She sips on the coffee.
Looks at a group of college kids at 
the table across the room.
They are celebrating a birthday.

She looks at one of the guys, whose birthday is being 
celebrated, who looks mildly like Piyush.
She turns her gaze 
back to Sadhya.
Slight discomfort on Devi’s face.
SADHYA JI
Sab mitron ke circle mein ek dost 
aisa hota hai naa jise sab gyaani 
maante hain...intellectual...
DEVI
Hmmm.
SADHYA JI
Humaare circle mein...college ke 
dinon mein...wo gyaani hum they.
Aur sab humse apni samasya ka hal 
maangte they.
DEVI
Achha?
Main toh Sarita mein

SADHYA JI
Aur hum sabko yahi kahte they...

Chhupa ke

Now he looks straight into Devi’s eyes.
Devi is also not 
avoiding the gaze.
SADHYA JI (CONT’D)
Toh ab jab aap jaa rahi hain...toh 
hum apne andar ke intellectual ki 
baat maan kar aapko kah hi dete

Devi suddenly feeling unsure of herself.
She looks at the 
group of college kids giving birthday bumps to Piyush-look-
alike.
The boy is screaming in pain.
Friends holding his 
hands and legs and kicking him ruthlessly.
Devi is watching 
all this and becomes very uncomfortable.
DEVI
(Panting and pretending to 
be calm)
Mujhe jaana hai.
Sadhya looks at her with a cold sigh.
Offers her a glass of

As it goes away, 
she stifles a sob.
She is crying and avoids being seen by

Both look towards the 
approaching ghaat.
Devi jumps out first, and as Deepak is 
about to jump off, the boat hits a rock and gives a strong 
jerk.
Deepak is about to lose his balance but Devi gives him
