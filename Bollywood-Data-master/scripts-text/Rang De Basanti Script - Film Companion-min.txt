VOICE
If yet your blood does not boil, 
then it is water that flows in your 
veins. For what is the flush of 
youth if it is not of service to the 
motherland. 
—Dushyant Kumar (1933–75)

I’m sorry it had to end this way. 
BHAGAT SINGH 
This isn’t the end Mr. McKinley. This 
is just the beginning. There will be 
others after we’re gone, many others.

INT. LONDON, BBC OFFICE, SUE McKINLEY’S CABIN—NIGHT 
The pages become yellow and worn, the ink fades. We pull back to reveal an 
attractive 26-year-old British girl. She’s sitting on a couch, her legs folded to 
her chest, reading McKinley’s diary. This is SUE McKINLEY. 
The camera moves around the cluttered room. Hundreds of photographs and 
a pile of research material [of the British Raj in India] covers every inch of 
visible space.

1931—EVENING 
The long corridor leads to a door which opens to reveal the towering 
gallows outside. 
JAMES McKINLEY stares intensely at the gallows as if he is facing his own 
death. The three young men stand at the gallows fearlessly. They look at 
each other and smile. Then their faces are covered by black cloth. JAMES 
McKINLEY looks at his watch.

As the trap door under their feet is opened, JAMES McKINLEY shuts his

INT. LONDON, BBC OFFICE, SUE McKINLEY’S CABIN—NIGHT 
SUE is sleeping on the couch. In extreme slow motion, the diary slips from 
SUE’s hand and falls. We follow the diary as it spirals down into inky shadows 
and is lost in the darkness. 
I/E. TITLE SEQUENCE 
We catch a glimpse of faded photographs and flickering 1920s newsreel 
footage of the brutal, oppressive British rule of India.

SUE strides across the busy open plan space.

INT. LONDON, BBC OFFICE, CONFERENCE ROOM—MORNING 
The three executives sit facing SUE at the table. BETH is the only one 
not smiling. 
SUE
Hi...Good Morning... 
But none of them seem to want to say anything. SUE, still confident, senses 
some tension in the air. She decides to break the silence and peels open her 
production folder to bring out a couple of documents and photographs. 
SUE 
So Sonia...My contact in Delhi. She’s found  
a steam train for us to film on. 
She passes them a photo which they only politely glance over. 
SUE 
But we need to wire her some money to secure it.
Everything’s cash out there. 
No one answers her. SUE suspects something. She looks towards BETH who 
should be her ally. 
SUE 
Have I come to the wrong meeting? 
The chief programmer and the young executive look at BETH; it’s her job to 
come clean. 
SUE fixes her a hard stare at BETH, wanting her to be direct. 
BETH 
We’ve had a directive from above...budget cuts... 
SUE sits still, eyes searching the faces. 
BETH 
So we had to take some very tough decisions. 
SUE’s face is frozen in disbelief.

Sorry, Sue. Really sorry. 
CHIEF PROGRAMMER 
(stepping in) 
If you were doing an episode on Gandhi, it would work for us.
The young executive nods enthusiastically. 
BETH 
(jumping in)
Gandhi sells, as does Che Guevara, even Robin 
Hood, but these other revolutionaries, this  
Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Ali... 
SUE 
Azad okay...Chandrashekhar Azad. And Azad means freedom. 
BETH 
Azad...sorry, I know what it means Sue. 
SUE 
I don’t believe this. You know...everything’s set up! 
I’ve been working on this for two years. I’ve been  
going to bloody Hindi night classes. 
SUE recomposes herself. 
SUE 
Look, please their story deserves to be told.
Look...this is my grandfather’s diary.  
He was an eyewitness... 
She angrily waves the diary in front of their faces. 
SUE 
It’s filled with real conversations...their very words.
Boys no older than 23, fighting the Empire. Okay that’s  
an important story, a bloody important...

Her voice trails off her, as she realises from the blank expressions that their 
decision is final. 
INT. LONDON, BBC OFFICE, SUE McKINLEY’S CABIN—DAY 
SUE angrily kicks the wastepaper basket across the room. Holding back 
the tears, she slumps in her chair, surrounded by her research. Among the 
paperwork and folders is her grandfather’s old pocket-watch with a shattered 
glass front. SUE picks it up and turns it over in her hand as her mind races. 
She reaches a decision. 
SUE 
This is not the end, Ms. McKinley. 
INT. LONDON, BBC OFFICE - DAY 
SUE walks down the corridor holding some files, the diary and some tapes. 
BETH calls her from behind. 
BETH 
Sue...Sue... Can I talk to you? 
She catches up with Sue. 
BETH 
Where are you going? 
SUE 
To India, to shoot a documentary. I’ll send you a postcard. 
BETH 
How? With what?
SUE 
Tumhari maa ki aankh!

SUE is at a loss for words. A voice interjects. 
SONIA (O.C.) 
Don’t worry, he’s with me. 
SUE turns to find herself face-to-face with a young attractive woman of 24, 
with a warm smile (SONIA). SONIA hugs SUE who is very relieved. 
SUE

It’s also been announced on radio.

SONIA 
After Alice, there was a call from

of the cancellation of the show and 
also my services...did you abuse

thrown by the attention, and gives a nervous grin.

One or two of them can be used for 
minor roles, but no one’s even close 
for Azad or Bhagat Singh.

EXT. DUST ROADS—DUSK

old fort ruins. A few cars and motorcycles speed along the dusty dirt track 
in front of a setting sun, towards the place known as THE CLASSROOM.

The classroom is fort ruins on top of a hill overlooking the city spread below. 
Passing a water reservoir surrounded by concentric stone steps we reach the 
high fort wall overlooking the city. 
Two bikes ride down the narrow fort wall towards a parapet. A few young 
boys and girls are hanging out. 
SONIA leads SUE along the wall. SUE looks around absorbing her 
surroundings. A good-looking boy [ASLAM] with long hair is scrawling 
graffiti on the wall.

CLOSE-UP: SUE’s eyes travel up to the narrow ledge until they land on... 
CUT TO: 
Two young men [DJ and SUKHI] are balancing precariously on the narrow 
ledge above the water reservoir. They are deliberately bending backwards and 
guzzling beer from bottles in a single gulp. They are daring each other—who 
will bend back further? They could both easily fall into the water!

HIGH ANGLE: The crane swoops down towards the young man who is 
the spectators’ favourite—this is the first time we see his face; this is DJ. He 
drains the last drop from his bottle and casually tosses it down into the water. 
The crowd cheers. 
DJ then sweeps up two more bottles and opens them with his kada (steel 
bangle). He throws one to SUKHI who totters as he catches the bottle. The 
crowd groans. DJ lifts his bottle up and acknowledges the crowd. The two do 
cheers with their bottles.

EXT. THE CLASSROOM, ARCHWAY—NIGHT
DJ sits astride his bike and offers SUE a ride.
DJ
Hey Sue, want a ride?
SONIA drags her away.
SONIA
You’ve got insurance, no?
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: Strains of ‘The Rebel’ fades in.
SUE shrugs ‘Sorry’ to DJ. He throws her a cocky look and races off, his 
wheels kicking up dirt as he turns the bike 360 degrees and then takes off, 
riding a wheelie.
ANGLE ON JEEP: SUE slumps in the back between SONIA, SUKHI and 
ASLAM. KARAN is at the wheel.
EXT. HIGHWAY—NIGHT
DJ rides his bike alongside the jeep. SUKHI leans out and holds a beer bottle 
out for DJ. Just as DJ reaches for it, KARAN swerves. There are roars of 
laughter from everyone. The entire ride is potent with the rush of adrenaline 
and youthful passion. SUE is intoxicated by these characters.

AZAD, one of the revolutionaries from the past, riding a bike (the ambience 
sounds recede).
EXT. DIRT TRACK—NIGHT
They now hit a dirt track. KARAN switches off the headlights. The dust 
particles dance like fireflies. His passengers shriek as they glide through 
darkness. SUE looks back and sees DJ’s headlight chasing after them. Then 
another light brightens behind him so that she can see DJ’s silhouette. The 
new light speeds past DJ. It’s a second bike and as it roars past the jeep, the 
rider gives them a thumbs-up sign.
SONIA
Love you...!
The rider, AJAY, blows a kiss at SONIA. She blows one back. 
EXT. HIGHWAY—NIGHT
The jeep thumps back onto the main road, its headlights coming back on so 
that we can see the two bikes racing each other. The camera following as AJAY 
lurches back on his bike and overtakes DJ. DJ goes full throttle and catches 
up. The bikes zoom away, leaving the jeep behind. DJ and AJAY can be heard 
whooping loudly as they speed off, neck to neck.
EXT. MITRO’S DHABA—NIGHT
A typical Punjabi dhaba (highway restaurant) with an old house at the rear. 
Attached to it is a small gurudwara (Sikh place of worship). Half the tables 
are placed close to the road, and the other half, in a makeshift interior. A bike 
skids to a halt outside. The rider pulls off his helmet—it’s DJ; however he 
doesn’t look triumphant—and now we see why. AJAY is calmly leaning back

The adda (hangout) is a tea stall at the University square. A small television 
is showing some fashion channel. The tea stall owner [Kaka] is pumping 
the stove; a young boy is serving tea, bun and omelettes. DJ, SUKHI and 
ASLAM are stuffing food in their mouths, checking out the stunning women 
on TV, rating them on a scale of one to ten.

EXT. PUNJAB, COUNTRYSIDE LANES—DAY
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: The first notes of the Song ‘Rang De Basanti’ 
fade in. 
PRAYER: EK OMKAAR
(There is) One God, eternal—true 
his name, creative his personage, 
fearless, with malice towards none, 
form beyond time and death, unborn, 
self-emanated; (can be realised by) 
Guru’s grace. Meditate (on Him). 
Before time (started ticking), He was 
‘The Truth’ (Everlasting);
When (cycle of) Ages started, He was 
‘The Truth’. Even now He is ‘The 
Truth’; True, O, Nanak, He Will 
Ever Be. (One) cannot achieve purity 
(and hence piety of mind, by simply) 
washing (body) clean, even hundred 
thousand times. By remaining mute 
(ever moving mind) stills not, 
(even if body seemingly) poses deep 
concentration. Hunger (lust and 
greed) of the hungry, ceases not, even 
if loads of world’s (choicest gifts) are 
tied to us and piled (around him). 
In fact, with meeting demands of 
mind, its craving goes on increasing. 
(One) may have a thousand, nay a 
kindred thousand worldly wisdoms, 
not even one will be of any avail (to 
him in the divine court). How then 
to become ‘Truthful’ and how veil of 
falsehood torn? (The answer is), by 
submitting O, Nanak, to the Pre-
ordained Written Command of the 
Lord of Will—God.

EXT. PUNJAB, VILLAGE—DAY
The gang attends a Punjabi wedding. DJ plays cards with the village oldies. 
SUE shoots the card game on her camera.
The rustic beauty of the Indian countryside affects SUE deeply. And her 
being a foreigner, her sense of dressing (shorts and vests), her sensuality and 
her body language affects the Indian villagers equally deeply. DJ is caught 
between the two.
DJ is rolling his bike. SUE is walking ahead. Some village women walk past 
with stacks of grass on their head. DJ gestures to them to put a stack on SUE’s 
head. They do it. SUE finds it very amusing.

At the wrestling pit, a giant of a wrestler who has just knocked out his 
opponent challenges the crowd, DJ finds his hand involuntarily raised by 
SUE. The giant lifts DJ up in the air like a mere toy and spins him around 
before throwing him back to the crowd. DJ lands on his friends. It takes the 
combined strength of DJ, KARAN, ASLAM and SUKHI to pin down the 
giant wrestler.

surroundings. DJ, ASLAM and LAXMAN PANDEY in their costumes, 
sit with their legs dangling, eating sugarcane. The camera travels over

The police chase them through the village, the fields and the river bed, led by 
the British sergeant on horseback. ASHFAQULLAH KHAN suddenly stops 
running and turns towards the posse. He urges RAMPRASAD BISMIL to 
run. Like a wall, he stands between the posse and RAMPRASAD BISMIL. 
Holding on to the reins of the running horse, he brings it to a halt, and with 
all his might, brings the horse and the rider down, making him stumble in 
the process, buying time for RAMPRASAD BISMIL.

JAMES McKINLEY (V.O.)
A master of disguise, he appeared 
and vanished at will. After months of 
frustration, came the breakthrough 
for 
the 
British 
Government. 
Banwarilal, the weakest of the 
revolutionaries in captivity, the 
man who had given us information 
on the whereabouts of Bismil and 
Ashfaqullah, agreed to be the bait to 
trap Azad. We had found our Judas.
BANWARILAL, the traitor with shifty eyes, scans the crowd for 
CHANDRASHEKHAR AZAD.
Crowds throng the Ramlila ground where the triumph of good over evil, the 
triumph of Lord Rama over Demon Ravana are being celebrated. There are 
huge 100-feet effigies of the Demon Ravana, his brother Kumbhakaran and 
son Meghnad. As faces, young and old, look up in wonder, policemen led 
by a British officer pretend to be tourists and await BANWARILAL’s signal.
In the crowd, disguised as a police officer, CHANDRASHEKHAR AZAD 
checks the bullets in his Mauser pistol. Then he spots BANWARILAL; with 
steely eyes he begins advancing towards him. When he is merely a few feet 
from BANWARILAL, he raises his Mauser pistol to go in for the kill, only to 
find himself looking into the barrels of many British guns.
CHANDRASHEKHAR AZAD

An arrow with a sparkler hits Ravan’s effigy.
BANWARI is happy with his own smartness, but the smile fades as he finds 
AZAD glance above his head and smile. Following his gaze BANWARI 
looks up and is horrified. The effigy explodes into flames. Ravan’s burning 
head is falling towards BANWARI. The crowd breaks into a mighty roar and 
moves back. There is a wave in the sea of people which crashes into the police 
surrounding AZAD.
Finding the perfect diversion, AZAD dives into the crowd just before the 
burning effigy falls on him. The British officers chase him through the fields.
AZAD manages to whisk away one of the motorcycles of the police. The 
policemen get on their bikes and chase him.
Note: (It is the same shot that SUE imagined when she saw DJ riding 
alongside KARAN’s jeep enroute to the CLASSROOM.) AZAD dives off 
the cliff on his motorcycle into the river and makes his getaway.

RAMPRASAD BISMIL
It’s not your fault. You’re only 
doing your duty. 
JAMES McKINLEY stops for a brief moment, his face betraying his 
inner turmoil.
INT. CHURCH, ALTAR—DUSK
The instrumental version of ‘Abide With Me’ plays. JAMES McKINLEY 
kneels before the altar, his eyes filled with tears. He’s angry...with his 
government...with himself...with his God.
JAMES McKINLEY
How can this be your will, tell me... Tell me...
Tell me... How can this be the will of God?
A teardrop escapes JAMES McKINLEY’s eyes. JAMES McKINLEY begins 
to recite the Lord’s Prayer.
INT. GORAKHPUR JAIL, RAMPRASAD BISMIL’S CELL; DECEMBER 
1927—DAWN
JAMES McKINLEY’s recitation blends with the words of RAMPRASAD 
BISMIL reciting from the Bhagvad Gita (holy book of the Hindus) as he 
takes a bath.
INT. FAIZABAD JAIL, ASHFAQULLAH KHAN’S CELL; DECEMBER 
1927—DAWN
ASHFAQULLAH KHAN applies kajal (kohl) to his eyes. On the soundtrack 
we hear verses being recited from the Holy Quran.

INT. DELHI UNIVERSITY, SUE’S HOSTEL ROOM—NIGHT
In a seamless transition, we are in SUE’s hostel room.
The last shot from the previous scene is playing, projected on the wall through 
SUE’s laptop, which is attached to a projector. The entire group is watching. 
The reel runs out now. The blank white screen stares back at them. They do 
not move.
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: Recitation of the three scriptures—Bhagvad 
Gita, Holy Quran, Lord’s Prayer—fades away.
A blanket of silence hangs over them. Only the resonance of what they just 
saw and heard remains. In the dark room, ASLAM and LAXMAN look at 
each other. SUE slowly gets up to put on the light. As the light comes on, for 
a moment, the two catch themselves staring at each other, then immediately 
look away. Just then AJAY opens the door.

ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE
British Movietone newsreel plays the nationwide protest against the visiting 
Simon Commission. The Empire strikes back, and the demonstrations are 
dispersed with severe measures. However, the people come back on the 
streets in thousands. In a seamless transition, we are now at a live protest at 
a railway platform.
EXT. LAHORE RAILWAY STATION, 30 OCTOBER 1928—DAY
A Superintendent of Police, J.A. SCOTT, is standing along the railway track 
on horseback. A large contingent of policemen led by a nervous Assistant 
Superintendent of Police [J.P. SAUNDERS] is cordoning the crowd.
The protestors are led by a 63 year old leader [LALA LAJPAT RAI]. The 
protestors are carrying black banners painted in white reading ‘Simon Go 
Home’ and raising slogans.
A young lady [DURGA BHABHI played by SONIA] leads a contingent of 
women. They are shouting slogans as well.

towards them slowly and peacefully. Pushing back the cordon, which is now 
insufficient to contain the crowd. J.P. SAUNDERS begins to retreat on his 
horse. The crowd is now all over the tracks getting out of control when J.A. 
SCOTT barks his orders.

We bade farewell, to this day, 
knowing it could be our last. 
We swore to play, with our lives, 
never waver in our task. 
For we have accepted the invitation, 
Of fate’s celebration of death. 
The police force led by J.P. SAUNDERS and SCOTT mercilessly rain blows 
on the crowd. BHAGAT SINGH and other revolutionaries (SUKHDEV, 
DURGA BHABHI, RAJGURU, BHAGWATICHARAN VOHRA, 
JAIGOPAL) encircle LALA LAJPAT RAI and form a human shield.
BHAGAT SINGH gets a blow on his head. He looks at the British officer 
with fire in his eyes and cries out—

BHAGAT SINGH
Long live the revolution!
The brutal lathi-charge continues.
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: The oath poem ‘Lalkaar’ echoes, making the 
scene appear almost surreal.

CHORUS (V.O.)
In our hearts we have a horde of 
storms, and the spirit of revolution in 
our veins. 
We will unleash this and more, and 
upon them we will rain.
The destination dare not defy us, 
when passion is our beacon.
Because this day, we walk with death, 
and laugh at its pale spectre. 
The protesters brave the blows without resistance; they stand their ground 
displaying great resilience, facing one blow after another.
One by one, BHAGAT SINGH, RAJGURU and SUKHDEV fall to the 
blows. DURGA BHABHI shields LALA LAJPAT RAI with her body and 
suffers blows. Gathering all her strength, she tries to protect LALA LAJPAT 
RAI but in vain, the next blow in the mayhem catches LALA LAJPAT RAI 
on the forehead and he collapses.
Superimposed: Newspaper headlines proclaiming the death of LALA LAJPAT 
RAI, the Lion of Punjab.

CLOSE UP: Spinning bicycle wheel.
CHANDRASHEKHAR AZAD, BHAGAT SINGH and RAJGURU 
are hiding behind pillars of the college building facing the police station, 
clutching guns in their sweaty hands.
The spinning bicycle wheel stops and through the spokes we see: J.P. 
SAUNDERS rides out of the gate, on his red motorcycle, and passes the man 
mending his bicycle. The man signals to the boys in hiding.
Suddenly RAJGURU steps out on the road in the path of the approaching 
motorcycle and shoots SAUNDERS at point blank range. SAUNDERS is 
hit on the head. He falls down. BHAGAT SINGH pumps more bullets into 
SAUNDER’s body.

INT. NDTV STUDIO, WE THE PEOPLE—DAY
A heated debate is in progress in a programme similar to ‘We the People’, 
conducted by celebrated news journalist PANKAJ PACHAURI. Experts 
voice their opinions, the IAF, the Ministry of Defence, the Russian makers 
of MiG aircraft, pilots who have been part of crashes and survived, families 
of dead pilots.

In the last 10 years, over 100 MiG-
21s of the IAF have crashed, in 
which over 30 pilots have lost their 
lives. Defence Minister Shastri, the 
CAG report states that old and 
defective Russian spare parts were 
procured by the government. Isn’t 
this a case of high-level corruption?

Not at all. I’ve personally clarified 
the issue in parliament. It’s is a 
downright lie. The youngsters of 
today are brash and irresponsible 
when it comes to flying planes.
An old gentleman, a RETIRED AIR FORCE OFFICER, at the studio

RETIRED OFFICER
No! I don’t agree. Flt. Lt. Ajay 
Rathod was an ace pilot whom I 
trained. He was a gold medalist, 
the youngest to clear night sorties 
with over 1000 flying hours. 
This can’t be the record of an 
irresponsible pilot.

AJAY’s MOTHER opens the door. An airman delivers a trunk containing 
AJAY’s belongings. He salutes her. AJAY’s MOTHER looks at the man...the

is about to fall. KARAN holds her for support.

Hundreds of flickering flames come into focus; they are lit candles floating up 
the road that leads to India Gate. AJAY’s bereaved family members, friends 
and relatives are accompanied by common middle-class people who have 
come out on the streets, and are peacefully marching towards the SOLDIER’S 
MEMORIAL with lit candles.
The procession is led by AJAY’s MOTHER and the rest follow.
Upon reaching India Gate, they place the candles and AJAY’s medals of 
honour along with a photograph of him respectfully on the ground. Then 
they sit around his photograph and the candles, in protest. Old people, young 
people, even children have come to India Gate with candles in their hands. 
It is a moving sight.

LAXMAN PANDEY
Ajay Rathod was not a novice. 
He didn’t let his plane crash into 
the town. When it developed a 
snag he didn’t try to save his life. 
He steered it clear of Ambala, 
saving thousands of civilians. Yet 
the Defence Minister calls him 
irresponsible. Right that’s enough 
now. We would like to know how 
many ministers in this country 
have sons are in the forces.
The sound of engines and police sirens fills the India Gate premises, drowning 
out the protesting voices. LAXMAN PANDEY does not give up. He raises 
his voice over the sound. A row of special police force (SPF) trucks drives up 
the slopes. SPF soldiers jump out even before the trucks come to a halt. They 
are dressed for riot control. Shields, batons and tear gas guns are offloaded as 
well. The crowd gets into a closer huddle.
EXT. INDIA GATE, SOLDIER’S MEMORIAL—DAY
A few jeeps and cars arrive and we see party workers from LAXMAN 
PANDEY’s group step out.
MISHRA is in one of the cars. He observes LAXMAN PANDEY. Then 
he instructs his party workers. The party workers move towards the speech 
makers and spread out among them. They start heckling the speakers and 
begin disrupting the proceedings. A scuffle begins to erupt between the party 
workers and the protestors. The SPF step in. They start to break up the protest.

To SUKHI’s horror the SPF Inspector slaps him hard on the face. A few SPF 
soldiers keep slapping him.
People are beaten up ruthlessly. SUE and DJ find two kids looking around in 
the chaos helplessly and crying. They can, be a stampede at any moment. The 
two rush to pick up the children and bring them to safety.
The boys are beaten mercilessly. AJAY’s MOTHER shields SONIA in her

LAXMAN PANDEY looks in dismay at the mayhem around him. He 
looks at his party members raining blows on the protesters. He sees 
his respected Mishraji sitting in his air-conditioned car and watching 
all this.
KARAN is brutally hit on the head, he falls. SUKHI is dragged on the road by 
his collar. SONIA is trying with all her might to protect AJAY’s MOTHER. 
LAXMAN PANDEY watches all this, numb with anger.
Some police officers and party workers are hitting ASLAM with lathis. They 
beat him mercilessly. Something snaps in LAXMAN PANDEY; he rushes 
towards ASLAM and snatches the baton from the cop and in blind rage beats 
the cop unconscious. Then he turns and repeatedly smashes the baton into 
the party workers. He then picks up the semi-conscious ASLAM and tries to 
take him to safety.
DJ tries to reach SONIA and AJAY’s MOTHER in vain, helplessly 
struggling against the crowd that separates them. As a gap clears in the 
seething crowd, DJ sees SONIA wailing as she cradles the limp body of 
AJAY’s MOTHER in her arms. A brutal cop has cracked a baton on AJAY’s 
MOTHER’s head.
Time slows down as SUE and DJ look on helplessly.

This system is so messed up, a

As I watched DJ sleep that night, 
a strange thought occurred to me. 
Maybe DJ wasn’t sleeping, maybe 
none of them were. Maybe they 
were all waking up.
EXT. AMRITSAR, JALLIANWALA BAGH; 13 APRIL 1919 (DREAM)—
DAY
Once again, we see the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. People being mowed down, 
General Dyer shouting commands, troops firing indiscriminately at unarmed 
men, women and children. The visuals have a dream-like abstract quality. We 
see a young BHAGAT SINGH, scooping blood-soaked mud into a bottle. 
Suddenly the troops are no longer British troops but they are Indians, all 
firing under the command of Defence Minister Shastri. Indians are killing 
Indians.
Just then the falling crowd parts to reveal AJAY in his Air Force uniform.
DEFENCE MINISTER SHASTRI
Fire!
He points towards AJAY. The troops fire. A bullet punctures his jacket.

Outside the gate, ASLAM is mending a bicycle. Through the spokes of the 
bicycle, we see DEFENCE MINISTER SHASTRI walking towards the 
gate, closely followed by his bodyguards.
FAST CAMERA PAN: KARAN kick-starts the bike; DJ is riding pillion. DJ 
pulls out a pistol.
LAXMAN PANDEY, putting on an act of a newspaper man on a cycle, 
engages the security guards in conversation.
KARAN and DJ ride towards DEFENCE MINISTER SHASTRI. DJ 
shoots at DEFENCE MINISTER SHASTRI once...twice...three times...
and then KARAN speeds away on the bike before the bodyguards realise 
what has happened. As the guards run behind the bike in vain, the ‘innocent 
newspaper man’ disappears.
CAMERA TILTS DOWN: The Defence Minister lies dead on the road with 
gunshot wounds gaping on his chest, blood oozing out, spreading over his 
clean white kurta (long shirt).

You made a joke of his death...

Inside, it is still the colonial edifice it was created to be. Only now, the dull

to tell everybody that something 
has to be done by all of us.

SONG: RU BA RU
Hey, dude!
I just realised
There’s a fire burning within me
It’s a new dawn, I can feel its light
So bright it could consume the sun
Cause I’m face to face with the light 
This fire is ready to face any storm
The flames burn brighter and stronger
Whether I leave my mark, 
Whether I stay the path 
Today I’ve tasted the light
Like a torch, I’m burning bright
Why must be keep bearing
Cause I’m face to face with the light
POV: The camera rushes towards the boys who are running away into a 
bright light.
