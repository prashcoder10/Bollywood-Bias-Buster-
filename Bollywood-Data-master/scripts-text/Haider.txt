FADE IN: 
It is the mid-1990s and the insurgency in Kashmir is at its 
peak. The Indian defence establishment is ﬁnding it difﬁcult 
to penetrate the extremist groups, which are supported by 
Pakistan and protected by locals. To meet this challenge, the 
Indian intelligence has formed the ‘Ikhwaan-ul-Muslameen’, 
a counter-insurgent militia comprising of surrendered and 
captured militants. The Ikhwaanis play a key role in reducing 
militancy in the valley. The Indian government has decided 
to hold elections within the next six months to show the 
world that things are under control in Kashmir. 
FADE OUT.

An identiﬁcation parade is under way. A major sits at the

The villagers are taking turns passing in front of the

building, where arrested men are being tortured. 
‘Khodayo Bachav!’ 
Save me.. Oh, Lord!
‘Nahin Pata Sir!’

The ﬁrst young man passes by the Mukhbir. We see 
anticipation on the faces of villagers in the ground, the relief

The Major reacts to the sounds of the bullets. Tense soldiers 
take aim and await commands. 
39 INT. HILAAL’S HOME - STAIRCASE CORRIDOR 
The ﬁring overwhelms the soldiers. One provides covering 
ﬁre as the other assists the injured lieutenant with the dead 
soldier’s body. They retreat. 
40 INT. HILAAL’S HOME - STAIRCASE CORRIDOR 
Ikhlaakh and his men have made their way down to the 
corridor window. They ﬁre at the soldiers. 
41 EXT. HILAAL’S HOME 
Soldiers retaliate to the ﬁring. The Major rushes towards the 
lieutenant who’s receiving ﬁrst aid. 
They both look at the dead soldier inside the van. Angry, the 
Major looks towards the house. 
42 EXT. HILAAL’S HOME - LATER 
The stand-off continues with sporadic ﬁring every few 
minutes. A handcuffed Hilaal is brought to the Major. 
A soldier with a small remote positions himself near the 

27
Major and nods. A beat. The Major looks back at Hilaal 
and whispers. 
MAJOR 
Qkbj! 
Fire!
At the click of a button, the explosives blow up the base of 
the house. Hilaal cries in horror. The Major signals to the 
men with rocket launchers. 
Within seconds two rockets ﬂy into the attic and the ﬁrst 
ﬂoor completely annihilating the structure. What’s left of 
the house goes up in ﬂames. 
FADE TO BLACK.

43 EXT. A BUS ON THE MOUNTAIN ROADS - DAY 
A young man looks through the window of a bus into 
nothingness - HAIDER MEER, in his early twenties. His 
eyes are heavy, red, as if after hours of crying. 
CUT TO: 
44 EXT. ARMY CHECK POST - JAWAHAR TUNNEL - 
DAY 
The bus slowly stops, he looks outside, it has halted behind 
a couple of other vehicles. It’s some kind of a road block. A

distant sound of gun ﬁring can be heard on the soundtrack. 
A soldier gets into the bus holding an automatic weapon.

Haider stands in a queue with his rucksack on the shoulders 
as soldiers frisk people after checking their IDs and luggage. 
A soldier checks Haider’s ID as a south Indian-looking 
ofﬁcer, LIEUTENANT NAGARAJAN, stands close to the

Haider sits alone inside a small room of the check post. 
He looks out through a small window. From the opposite 
end a Maruti 800 drives in from afar. He recognizes it. The 
soldiers get alert. They run and stop it at a distance. 
A petite, beautiful, yet forceful girl in a pink salwar kameez, 
a long beige coat and a woollen cap, hanging a press card 
from her neck, comes out. This is ARSHIA LONE. She 
shows her press ID and the press sticker of Kashmir Post 
pasted on her car.

Haider comes out. Arshia, who was chatting with the 
lieutenant, turns. Their eyes meet, a look of longing and 
desire. She walks up to him, close, holding herself from 
hugging him. A beat. 
ARSHIA

He hands over a diary to Haider. 
 LIEUTENANT NAGARJAN 
 By the way... nice poetry.
Haider is embarrassed. 
 LIEUTENANT NAGARJAN 
 Be careful with such beautiful inspiration. Okay?
Arshia smiles at Haider. Haider smiles back broadly, faking 
the delight.

been written for me... since we were kids.
No reaction from Haider. She turns a bend and stops the car 
by the road outside a village, surrounded by empty ﬁelds. 
She hugs him tight.

They drive into town, passing through army bunkers,

50 EXT. HILAAL’S HOME - LATER 
Haider stands shocked opposite the burnt, torn-down 
structure. It’s beyond his belief seeing what’s left of the 
house he grew up in. Arshia stands behind giving him space. 

37
51 INT. HILAAL’S HOME 
The foundation walls of the structure are still in place. As 
he walks through the house, he sees charred remains of the 
furniture, the staircase, etc. 
Flashes of his childhood appear before him as he walks 
through the house. 
-Young Haider and Hilaal engrossed in a serious table-tennis 
match in the attic as Ghazala calls out to them for lunch. 
- Dawn, young Haider crawls into bed in between Ghazala 
and Hilaal snuggling up to them inside the blanket. 
- Hilaal displays a ten-rupee note to a sheepish young Haider. 
HILAAL

He urges Haider on to ﬁnish the poem, the boy thinks hard.

Suddenly he blurts out the rest of the poem and quickly 
grabs the note.

-Young Haider rushes to brush Hilaal’s shoes as Hilaal 
leaves for ofﬁce in the morning. 
Flashback ends: 
Haider bends down to pick a video cassette, something 
catches his attention on the ground. A photo-frame housing 
a photo of Hilaal, Ghazala and Haider. 
He falls to his knees, crying in disbelief as he picks up the 
photo. Arshia places her hand on his shoulder, comforting 
him. 
CUT TO:

one.

Haider gets down from an auto outside a small bungalow 
located in a modest middle-class locality in Srinagar. The 
name plate on the bungalow reads ‘Khurram Meer - B.A. 
LLB - Advocate High Court’. 
Haider opens the gate and enters, an old man comes out of 
the corridor. A face Haider recognizes and knows well. The 
old man hugs him tight, his eyes are moist. 
59 INT. KHURRAM’S HOME - LIVING ROOM 
Haider walks through the corridor, photographs of his 
father and uncle on the walls. He hears a faint singing 
voice of a male, coming from the other end. He follows 
the voice. 

48
Through the thin wooden curtain he sees Khurram singing 
a Kashmiri song holding a cup of tea in between his palms. 
The smoke ﬂowing out of the cup in the backdrop of the 
evening sunlight makes the atmosphere magical. Ghazala 
seems rather cheerful and happy. She is trying to hold her 
amusement as Khurram sings. 
KHURRAM

Ghazala shakes her head to say no. Khurram presses her

Ghazala picks up her cup and starts to sing while blowing 
the vapours away from the cup. Khurram slowly gets up 
and starts to gently dance along. His steps have a kind of 
sweetness of the local folk dance. Ghazala is amused and 
gets into giggles in between her singing. 

50
Haider enters the room pushing the see-through wooden 
curtain aside. 
Ghazala casually turns with a smile, still humming. She stops, 
seeing Haider. She suddenly becomes pale and whispers to 
herself. 
GHAZALA

Khurram looks at her and follows her gaze. He is startled 
to see Haider standing behind. He gets up trying to gather 
himself.

60 EXT. SRINAGAR - DAY 
In a market area of the city, an awkward-looking stand-
alone structure has a sign in front that says.
Salman & Salman video: all types VHS cassettes available. 
On the shop front we see a few small posters. (Maine Pyar 
Kiya. Deewana Mastana.) And a faded poster: Lion of the 
Desert. 
On the soundtrack, we hear a hit cheesy Bollywood song. 
61 INT. SALMAN & SALMAN VIDEO SHOP - INNER 
ROOM 
Close-up of a television on which grainy visuals of the 
same song play, in which Salman Khan, sporting a mullet 
hairstyle, is dancing his heart out. 
We pull back, to see two young men in front of the TV, 
emulating the actor’s moves with the utmost conviction. 
Both wearing jeans and a white vest, they also sport mullets 
identical to the movie star. They lip-sync the lyrics as they 
continue dancing with passion and admiration. They are 
SALMAN & SALMAN. 
The room is full of smoke and the walls adorned with a few 
Salman Khan posters. 
The phone rings, they hear it but keep dancing. A beat. It 
rings again. 
Salman 1 picks up the cordless receiver, still dancing.

An irritated Salman 2 passes the receiver back to Salman 1. 
SALMAN 2

Hello...
As the song on TV reaches its crescendo. Salman 1 takes the 
receiver back but doesn’t place it on his ear. Instead both 
Salmans vigorously tear off their vests as does the Salman 
on screen. The song ends, an irritated voice is heard in the 
receiver.

screen. They start to dance again. 
CUT TO: 
62. EXT. MARKET ROAD - SRINAGAR - EVENING 
An enraged and dejected Haider walks on the isolated road 
with his bag. A bakhtarbadh (armoured) vehicle drives up 
to him slowly from behind. 
A masked and armed CRPF jawan with his upper body 
sticking out of the vehicle calls out to Haider. 
CRPF JAWAN 
:dks… dgk¡ tk jgs gks\

Haider snaps out of his trance-like walk and looks at the 
vehicle which stops beside him. The jawan comes out and

Haider pulls out his ID from his wallet as he spreads his 
hands to be frisked. The jawan frisks him thoroughly. 
Just then from the adjacent lane, Salman & Salman ride in 
on a motorcycle. They see Haider being frisked and ride up 
to him.

Downtown Kashmir at night. A few dogs wail on the street.

Haider stares at the photograph. An old woman sitting 
beside him sees Hilaal’s photo. Their eyes meet, she smiles at 
him, runs her shrivelled hand over his head and shows him a 
picture of her young son. They share a sad smile. 
He looks up and sees a dozen other people in the same room, 
with similar photographs of their loved ones. A sudden sense 
of a reality check hits him.

Barbed wire and armed soldiers surround the walls of this 
impenetrable military camp. Haider walks up to the gate 
with his rucksack on his back. A couple of jawans standing 
in a bunker order him to stop. Haider is cold and doesn’t 
respond to their threats. The soldiers warn him again, 
but  as there is no response, they approach him with guns 
pointed, alarmed.  Haider raises his arms as he is pinned to 
the ground. The soldiers hurriedly search his back; nothing 
but photocopies of Hilaal’s photo pour out.

He takes out a copy of Hilaal’s photograph. The sun rises 
over the blue-gray pines and bleached Himalayas circling 
Srinagar. The boatman stops rowing and takes the picture 
from Haider. He looks at it carefully, then shakes his head 
in the negative. 
78 EXT. LAWNS - DAY 
A group of women is seated on the lawns behind a banner 
that reads: Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons.

dozen bodies from the truck. Many have their faces blown 
up, some have limbs missing. They line them up on the 
morgue verandah on stretchers. Arshia turns her face away, 
runs towards a corner and vomits. Haider rushes ahead 
like a mad man, moving from one body to another. On one 
stretcher a young boy lies drenched in blood. He opens his 
eyes. Haider screams and steps back. 
The boy is alive. He jumps out of the stretcher, looks at 
everyone and shouts:

85 FLASHBACK 
Ghazala is in Haider’s room cleaning up. She gathers some 
textbooks to put inside Haider’s backpack, and feels a metal 
thing inside the bag. She pulls it out. It’s a pistol. She is 
shocked. 
Haider, age sixteen, being scolded by Ghazala who is 
freaking out.

GHAZALA

She slaps him hard. Haider is fuming. She holds him by his 
hair. 
GHAZALA

Are you going to cross the border? Going for arms 
training in Pakistan?
Haider frees himself from her grip and screams. 
HAIDER

Yes, I’ll go across. I will! 

82
Ghazala is shocked. Tears form in her eyes as Haider leaves 
to go out. She runs and comes in his way and holds him 
affectionately. 
GHAZALA
tkuk... ugha... 
My dear… no… 
Haider is quiet. She unties the scarf from her head and puts 
it on his feet. He steps back. Tears roll off her cheeks. 
He suddenly runs out of the house. Ghazala sees him running 
away into the ﬁelds.

Ghazala rings the bell at the same bungalow which we have

A young Khurram opens the door. Tears are still rolling off 
Ghazala’s cheeks.

Roohdaar slowly turns into a small lane, away from the 
soldiers. Arshia follows quickly and calls from behind. 
ARSHIA

ROOHDAAR

Arshia watches him walk away. 
CUT TO: 
105 EXT. UN OBSERVER’S OFFICE - SRINAGAR - DAY 
Outside the gates of the UN ofﬁce, the Association of Parents 
of Disappeared Persons holds a demonstration, with several 
people, mostly women. They display large banners and 

106
photos of disappeared people ‘Where is my father?’, ‘Did 
they vanish into thin air?’ Haider is amongst the crowd, he 
holds a banner in his hand, it reads: 
‘Shall we be or not be?’ ^ge gSa] fd ge ugha* 
Haider, the Salmans and several others with him shout out 
the slogan. 
ALL

Shall we be, or not be?
Arshia gets out of her car scanning the crowd for Haider. A 
sense of concern and panic in her actions. She locates him. 
ARSHIA

Haider...
Haider looks at her but keeps shouting the slogan, 
aggressively. Salman and Salman look on curiously. 
ARSHIA

Haider... Listen to me.
She ﬁnally holds him and shakes vigorously. 
ARSHIA

107
Haider suddenly stops and looks at Arshia. Salman & 
Salman get even more curious and alarmed. 
CUT TO: 
106 INT. PHONE BOOTH - LATER 
Inside the booth, Haider dials the number. The phone rings 
at the other end, nobody answers. Arshia grabs the receiver 
and listens, still no reply. Disheartened they’re about to cut 
the call when suddenly a hoarse male voice answers the 
phone. Arshia hurriedly passes the receiver to Haider.

A soft laughter from the other side.

109
The call is disconnected. Arshia looks at Haider anxiously. 
The Salmans watch intrigued, trying to ﬁgure out the 
conversation from outside the booth. 
CUT TO: 
107 EXT. DOWNTOWN SRINAGAR - DAY 
Roohdaar stands alone leaning on his walking stick, smoking 
at the corner of the bridge at Downtown. Across the road, 
Arshia’s car arrives. She recognizes Roohdaar. Their eyes 
meet, he puts out his cigarette and nods his head backwards, 
gesturing to be followed. Haider opens the door of the car, 
Arshia holds his hand. 
ARSHIA 
Downtown esa dqN Hkh gks ldrk gS- Be careful, gSnj- 
Anything can happen in Downtown… please be 
careful, Haider…

110
Haider presses her hand softly. She hugs him. A photo is 
clicked. We see Salman and Salman at a distance taking 
pictures. 
Haider gets down and crosses the bridge as Arshia watches 
him disappear into the alleys. 
SALMAN 1 
To go? 
SALMAN 2 
Or not to go? 
They look at each other. 
CUT TO: 
108 EXT. DOWNTOWN SRINAGAR - LANES 

111
Roohdaar marches forward closely followed by Haider. 
Salman and Salman follow Haider, keeping a safe distance. 
The lanes get narrower, cold and harsh faces stare at Haider. 
Salman and Salman see a few young militants with guns 
ahead in the street. They are apprehensive, slow down their 
pace and join a small crowd listening to cricket commentary 
on radio outside a shop. 
The militant boys wish Roohdaar, who nods in return. The 
militants start to follow Haider. 
Salman and Salman walk faster to catch up. Suddenly 
Salman 2 hears a song coming out of a TV screen from 
inside a barber shop. He stops and looks at the TV. The 
song is from a Salman Khan ﬁlm - ‘Kabootar ja ja ja’. The 
heroine releases a pigeon from her palms with an envelope 
around its neck. 
Following Roohdaar, Haider goes deeper into the labyrinth 
of lanes. As Haider turns a corner, two young men suddenly 
overpower him and cover his face with a black cloth. He 
struggles as the men push him into a waiting van at the side. 
CUT TO: 
108A EXT. ISLAMIC GRAVEYARD - DAY 
The same van is parked outside a two-storied house in the 
middle of the graveyard. A few men unload a large supply 
of weapons from a car and head inside the house. A couple 
of teenage boys and a girl help them. 
109 INT. ISLAMIC GRAVEYARD 
The black hood is raised from Haider’s face; he squints as 
the daylight hits his eyes. Roohdaar sits facing Haider. An 

112
old man (gravedigger) places cups of tea in front of them 
and leaves. 
HAIDER

We see Roohdaar inside the adjacent cell crowded with

He bends down, a suggestion of him picking up his penis 
and inserting the wire inside. The man screams in pain. 
The masked soldier nods towards another soldier near 
the electric board. He puts the switch on. The man shakes 
violently from the electric current.

Hilaal to see Khurram watching them coldly. A beat. 
The Ikhwaanis poke them with their guns, urging them on. 
Hilaal and Roohdaar walk conﬁdently and deﬁantly, aware

An Ikhwaani opens ﬁre on Hilaal. He is down in seconds. 
Roohdaar tries to scream but nothing comes out of his

Roohdaar. Parvez is alarmed, he quickly ﬂips through 
other photographs and stops on one in which Roohdaar 
can clearly be seen. 
PARVEZ

133 INT. GIFT SHOP - DAY 
A small board on the cash counter announces: ‘1 Rupee 
per call (for 3 minutes only)’. Arshia holds the receiver and 
listens to the ring on the other side. Roohdaar’s chit with a 
phone number scribbled over it lying next to the phone. 
The salesman comes and hands her a packet wrapped in 
bright gift paper. 
The phone keeps ringing on the other side. Dejected, she 
puts it down and looks at the gift-wrapped packet, picks up 
the chit and leaves.

134 INT. PARVEZ HOME - DAY 
Parvez cooks in the kitchen as the servants help. Arshia

she had been knitting for him. She wraps it around his neck. 
He is overwhelmed by emotions, pulls her nose. 
PARVEZ

CUT TO: 
137 EXT. LAL CHOWK - SRINAGAR - LATER 
Khurram’s car takes a turn onto a street where there is a trafﬁc 
jam. The driver curses in Kashmiri. Khurram looks up front. 
KHURRAM

What’s happened?
DRIVER  
(in Kashmiri) 
irk ugha lkgc- 
Trafﬁc is blocked at the square...
He hurriedly steps out of the car to see the extent of the jam. 
He looks through the various vehicles standing in front. 
Through the vehicles and crowd the cause of the jam is 
revealed. It’s Haider! With a clean-shaven head and beard 
he stands in the middle of the main square, wearing the 
American ﬂag as a bandana around his forehead on an old 
suit slightly large for him. He has a stethoscope around his 
neck like a tie. A transistor radio-cassette player is tied to his 
back, speakers outwards, its antenna pulled all the way out. 
He has a glint in his eyes, a touch of instability. 
It takes Khurram a moment to recognize him. Ghazala also 
comes out. She is shocked to see Haider in this new avatar. 

143
He begins to orate loudly as if giving a speech, but to nobody 
in particular.

A Muslim priest recites ‘fateha’ at the grave of Hilaal, which

announcing ‘Conﬁdential’.

Khurram opens the ﬁle on a small table as Haider looks on.

as he looks at his mother’s smiling face through the crowd. 
Khurram looks at Haider and smiles. Haider’s eyes display 
hatred and hurt. Khurram’s smile fades out. Ghazala follows 
Khurram’s gaze, Haider is gone.

141 EXT. BHAAND VILLAGE - DAY 
A group of street theatre actors rehearse the dance in the 
middle of the village. They are dressed in garish costumes 
and wear funny yet intriguing masks on their faces. Live 
musicians play Kashmiri folk music. Haider, dressed as a 
joker wearing a mask, also dances along. Kids of the village 
enjoy the performance. 
Arshia’s car stops outside the village. She walks inside to ﬁnd 
Haider dancing with full gusto with the group. She is happy 
to see him so cheerful. Haider notices her while dancing. He 
runs to her in joy. 
He twirls her around as he keeps singing. She laughs seeing 
him in an upbeat mood. Suddenly, he sees the Salmans 
looking at them from behind a tree. 

155
HAIDER

Bloody spies!
He grabs her hand and runs deeper into the village. Salman 
and Salman follow them. A chase begins - Haider manages 
to smartly evade the Salmans, who are now lost in the 
labyrinth of the village lanes. They run around but don’t 
ﬁnd them anywhere. A poem in a whispering voice starts to 
hum very softly on the soundtrack. 
142 I/E. HOLLOW CHINAR TREE 
A big chinar tree in the middle of the village square. In 
the claustrophobic conﬁnes of the hollow tree, Haider and 
Arshia stand in a tight embrace.

They kiss passionately and make love as the poem continues 
on the soundtrack.

That is the question... The answer to that is also a 
question. 
She looks at him confused.

A streak of madness is seen in his eyes. He takes out the 
pistol from his bag and puts it on his heart and then on the

The ceremony continues in the other room. Arshia sits on a

standing at the door. On his face we hear Ghazala’s voice. 
GHAZALA

A small cheer from the crowd. A looney smiles appears on 
Haider’s face. Parvez enters and looks at Haider. The music 
from the next scene fades in.

150 INT. AISHMUQAM SHRINE - EVENING 
A festive mood. Tents are pitched, a small number of friends 
and dignitaries have gathered. The seating surrounds the 
central open space, like an amphitheatre. 
Guests congratulate Ghazala and Khurram who sit at the 
centre, on two throne-like chairs. Parvez, with Arshia to his 
side, accompanies Khurram. 
The Bhaand Pather begins. Masked entertainers come 
twirling in with the sounds of live instruments. The lead 
narrator, a masked Haider, begins the play. The players - 
the old king, the new king and the queen, along with their 
subjects. 
The lyrics tell the story of the newly-crowned king after he 
betrayed and murdered his own brother, the older king. 
The song tells of how the new king longed for the queen and 
would do anything to have her. The old king was considered 
a traitor by the feudal lord who conquered their kingdom. 
His brother was hand-in-glove with the feudal lord, therefore 
they both conspired to trap the old king and killed him to 
ensure that the kingdom and the queen would be the new 
king’s forever. 
There are details of the killing, with the body being thrown 
from the ‘Zero Bridge’. 
Ghazala and Khurram are visibly disturbed. Khurram, 
seething from inside, doesn’t ﬂinch an inch. With a ﬁnal 
dance move Haider kneels before Khurram to end the 
powerful performance. The audience is silent. A beat. 
Khurram claps gently. He inches closer towards Haider and 
whispers, glaring into his eyes. 

165
KHURRAM

Haider is silent. Khurram pulls down his mask, to reveal his 
teary-eyed face. Khurram wipes off his tears.

equally stunned. She looks at Parvez who avoids her gaze. 
Khurram turns his face around.

Khurram. 
GHAZALA

Haider looks at the policeman walking towards him. He 
suddenly runs. The policeman chases him. 
GHAZALA

Haider...
He is gone. Haider dodges everyone, hits a few of them while 
escaping through the alleys. He takes a turn and suddenly 
Salman and Salman appear from nowhere. One of them hits 
him hard on the back of his head with a wooden log. Haider 
bangs into a wall and passes out.

Arshia lies on the bed of her room, looking nowhere. Her 
eyes are red after hours of crying. The plateful of food

Parvez knocks gently on the door of her room.

Haider sleeps on the bed. Ghazala sleeps next to him on a 
chair, her hand over his chest. 
The door opens, Hilaal stands there in prison clothes, his 
hands and legs chained. He slowly walks to the bed and sits

Haider’s eyes snap open. He ﬁnds himself alone in the empty 
room, his body full of sweat. Ghazala sleeps next to him on 
a chair, her hand over his chest. He slowly puts her hand 
away, looks at the time - 5:02 AM. It’s still dark outside, at 
a distance we hear the faint sounds of the morning ‘azaan’. 
He gets up and walks to the bathroom. He lifts the upper 
part of the ﬂush tank and takes out the Chinese pistol. He 
comes out and looks at Ghazala, she is still asleep.

156 INT. KHURRAM’S HOME - PRAYER ROOM 
He peeps into the room to see Khurram kneeling down in 
prayer, his back towards Haider. Khurram murmurs the

Salman run to overpower Haider. 
Inside - Khurram ends his prayers.

Outside - chaos of voices as the Salmans along with Parvez 
struggle to overpower Haider. 
Ghazala comes out hearing the commotion. Khurram walks

The jeep travels on a bumpy barren terrain. Salman and 
Salman sing along to a hit Salman Khan song blaring on the 
music system. Behind, the guards sit casually with weapons 
on their laps while Haider is seated on the opposite side. 
The road gets bumpier, Salman tries to control the vehicle. 
Haider seizes the moment and pounces onto the guards. A 
ﬁst-ﬁght between them. The car swerves out of control, one 
guard falls over losing his grip on his gun, Haider grabs it, 
pulls the trigger and shoots randomly. The bullets hit both 
of them and blood splashes on the glass screen separating 
the back from the front. Salman completely loses control of 
the jeep, crashing into a tree head-on. 
Haider bangs into the wall of the jeep and gets knocked 
out due to the collision. Salman and Salman take a peek 
behind to see Haider lie unconscious, they quickly get out 
and head back to unlock the door. Salman 1 unlocks the 
door as Salman 2 holds the pistol. Haider violently kicks it 
open pushing Salman 1 back. He bangs into Salman 2, his 
pistol ﬂies away. 
Haider climbs out of the jeep pointing the AK 47 towards 
Salman and Salman.

back, they pick the gun and shoot at him but the magazine 
is over. A beat. 
HAIDER 
pqVt+ik! 
Chutzpah!
Haider lunges for the pistol lying nearby. Both the Salmans 
run for their life. 
Haider aims and ﬁres, missing both of them, he ﬁres a 
couple more times, missing again. They cackle like a couple 
of hyenas, calling him names. Haider puts the gun back into 
his back pocket and picks a big stone. 
The Salmans keep running. Suddenly we hear a THUD! 
Salman 1 falls to the ground immediately, blood oozes out 
from the back of his head. Salman 2 turns to him. Another 

178
THUD! He screams in pain as a stone hits him hard on the 
face. His nose now bleeding, he looks up at the distance 
to see Haider running towards him with a few rocks in his 
hands. Salman 2 runs. Salman 1 tries to get up but another 
stone hits him hard. He falls again. Haider aims another 
rock at Salman 1, it knocks him down as well. With every 
throw Haider is more violent and ﬁerce. 
Teary-eyed Salman 2 drags himself over to Salman 1’s body. 
SALMAN 
lyeku!… lyeku…! 
Salman! Salman!
He shakes Salman’s lifeless body violently, his own face full 
of blood. Haider catches up behind them. Salman cries for 
mercy. Haider picks up a large stone with both hands, raises 
it in the air and swings downwards.

An autorickshaw stops in front of the burnt house. Ghazala 
comes out wearing a pheran. Her head is covered with a 
scarf and eyes with big sunglasses. She looks at the house. 
Emotions run through her veins. 
CUT TO: 
168 INT. HILAAL’S HOME 
Ghazala enters the house, her feet crushing the debris of the 
charred wood. 
She looks at the mirror on the wall. Its cracked from the

HAIDER

My Janus-faced mother.
She turns to see Haider walking behind. He comes closer and 
turns her around to face the mirror. He holds her face from 
the chin and tightens the grip with each word he speaks.

Parvez’s car passes through the lane adjacent to Hilaal’s 
burnt house. He notices a red-coloured fabric lying at the 
corner of the road. He asks his driver to stop the car. 
Parvez walks down to the corner and picks the cloth, it is 
his red mufﬂer woven by Arshia, the same he tied Haider’s 
hands with. He looks towards the burnt house.

Parvez peeps through the slit of the door to ﬁnd Haider 
holding the pistol at Ghazala’s forehead. He stumbles behind 
the door. Haider turns and shoots at the door. The bullet 
hits him right in the forehead through the door. He falls 
on his security guard standing behind him. They both come 
crashing down on the ground. Ghazala screams. Haider 
runs through the other exit as Parvez’s security guard shoots 
at him.

Arshia sits next to Parvez’s dead body. Her eyes are blank

They look at each other in silence. 
We hear a car door slam shut. Moments later Liyaqat 
storms into the room. His handbag slung on his shoulder. 
He freezes at the doorstep. Arshia looks at him, suddenly 
she gets up and runs to him. She cries in his arms as tears 
roll off his cheeks. 
Liyaqat walks to Parvez’s body, kneels down, holds his 
lifeless hand and breaks down. 
Khurram comes up from behind and rests his hand on 
Liyaqat’s shoulder to console him. He looks up behind. A 
beat. 
Liyaqat stands and pushes Khurram back violently.

Funeral starts from Parvez’s house. The cofﬁn is lifted by

A soft humming of a female voice-overlaps the soundtrack.

179 INT. PARVEZ HOME PORCH - LATER 
Only a few ladies of the neighbourhood are present in the 

193
house. A devastated Arshia sitting alone on the porch, hums 
a Kashmiri song of Habba Khatoon. She pulls out strands 
of wool from the mufﬂer she had woven for her father. Her 
belongings from the bag - a diary a photo album etc. - are 
lying on the ﬂoor next to her. Ghazala comes from behind

Arshia keeps humming, oblivious to Ghazala’s presence. 
Ghazala sees a photograph of Haider and Arshia kept in

As she keeps the notebook back a piece of paper falls on the 
ground. The same chit Roohdaar had passed off to Arshia. 
Ghazala looks at the name written over it - ‘Roohdaar’ - 
and a phone number scribbled against it. She looks back at 
Arshia. She continues to sing while pulling out the strands 
of the wool.

The old man sings standing inside a grave, throwing soil out 
with every swing of his shovel. He is the gravedigger. Behind 
him in three adjacent graves are two other old men, Mohsin 
and Ali, and a young boy, Akram, twelve. 
All three old men dig and sing in sync. A song of life and 
death, of slaughter and massacre, of burial and exhumation.

A mysterious ﬁgure walks up to them. The gravedigger 
looks up. It’s Haider. 
GRAVEDIGGER

MORNING 
Haider wakes up to the sounds of chants. At the window 
he sees that a small funeral procession has entered the 
graveyard. He recognizes one of Parvez’s servants amongst 
the handful of people. One of the gravediggers walks in, 
Haider still looking out of the window.

The maulvi begins the ritual. Haider comes in trudging from 
behind Liyaqat, completely defeated and crying. 
HAIDER

He kneels down before her. Liyaqat can’t believe his eyes. 
He trembles with anger as Haider holds her dead body, 
which is covered with a white shroud. Liyaqat turns to the 
servant and whispers.

LIYAQAT

Inform Khurram... Quickly!
The servant makes a run for it. Liyaqat comes forth and 
violently kicks Haider. He falls away on the ground. 
Liyaqat kicks Haider repeatedly as he tries to reach Arshia. 
Finally Haider retaliates and pushes him hard, Liyaqat 
topples over near the grave. 
Haider walks back and holds Arshia’s dead body covered in 
the shroud. Liyaqat, raging with fury, runs back and starts 
hitting Haider who is not ready to leave Arshia’s body. 
The maulvi and others scatter in fear as the ﬁght gets 
brutal. Upon seeing this, Mohsin runs to the entrance of the 
graveyard compound to look for the gravedigger. Liyaqat 
picks up a shovel and hits Haider hard on the back of his 
head. He falls down as Arshia’s body falls into the dug-up 
grave. 
186 EXT. ISLAMIC GRAVEYARD - ENTRANCE 
Outside the compound, the gravedigger is with Akram, 
helping him climb into his school bus. From behind he hears 
Mohsin’s voice calling out to him. 
The gravedigger turns to see him as Akram’s bus drives 
away.

Liyaqat towers above as he showers more kicks and blows. 
Liyaqat raises the shovel for a ﬁnal blow. 
A tombstone lies near the dug-up grave, Haider grabs it and 
with one mighty swing hits Liyaqat straight across the head, 
immediately knocking him out cold. Liyaqat drops dead on 
the ground. 
A weak and bloodied Haider gets up and walks towards the 
grave. He embraces Arshia’s lifeless body.

body at one of the graves. Khurram signals to two soldiers 
to retrieve the body. 
Those two run towards the body, when suddenly two quick 
rounds of gunﬁre hit them and knock them down. 
Alarmed, Khurram and gang take cover behind a rock. They 
look towards the structure.

The nozzle of an AK 47 stealthily peeps out from the second-

Ikhwaan soldiers stealthily tiptoe towards the back of the

The gravedigger peeps out the window and ﬁres from his 
AK47. The Ikhwaanis retreat. 
193 EXT. ISLAMIC GRAVEYARD 
The Ikhwaans get closer by hiding behind trees and graves 
in front of the house. At every chance they get they open ﬁre, 
only to be met with retaliatory ﬁre from the windows. 
194 INT. ISLAMIC GRAVEYARD - DIGGER’S HOME 
Mohsin has taken position at a window and is unleashing an 
onslaught of gun-ﬁre towards the Ikhwaan soldiers. 
All the while Haider holds Arshia’s body and softly reads a 
poem to her. 
195 I/E. ISLAMIC GRAVEYARD 
By now a full-ﬂedged battle is taking place between the 
Ikhwaans and the gravedigger family. 
Two Ikhwaani soldiers manage to reach and hide below the 
place where Ali was ﬁring from. As Ali opens the window, 
the two Ikhwaan soldiers shower bullets. Ali screams and 
falls back. The gravedigger runs to the room to ﬁnd Ali dead 

204
in a pool of blood. The gravedigger holds his dead body and 
howls. 
Haider notices the two soldiers coming closer. He quickly 
reaches an AK47 but fumbles as he tries to load it. The 
Ikhwaanis are barely a few feet away from him now, only a 
wall separates them. He struggles, barely managing to cock 
the weapon and ﬁre rather amateurishly, killing one of the 
two just as they appear from behind the wall. The other 
retreats. 
The grieving gravedigger picks up a grenade, runs out of 
the house and hurls it onto an Ikhwaan jeep. The jeep 
explodes, Khurram rolls over behind the rock as the bodies 
ﬂy apart. The gravedigger is showered with bullets by the 
other Ikhwaanis. 
196 EXT. ISLAMIC GRAVEYARD 
Khurram gets up and looks from behind the rock. A few 
Ikhwaanis try to move towards the structure, Mohsin and 
Haider both ﬁre bullets from different vantage points inside 
the house. They rush to different windows to ﬁre more 
rounds, giving the impression of several people inside the 
house. 
Ikhwaanis immediately turn back. Khurram pulls out his 
satellite phone and dials a number.

A jeep with a few Ikhwaanis stops a few metres away. The 
soldiers show a rocket launcher from inside. A smile emerges 
in Khurram’s eyes.

The house rocks from inside as dust and smoke engulf the 
interior. Haider holds Arshia’s body tightly in his arms and 
coughs as the debris falls over him. As the dust settles he 
notices Mohsin’s dead body. 
203 EXT. ISLAMIC GRAVEYARD 
Another rocket is ﬁxed to the launcher. The Ikhwaani 
soldier takes the aim to shoot but stops seeing his fellow 
soldier comes running towards them. The soldier stops near 
Khurram and shows him the walkie-talkie. 
SOLDIER 
vkidh choh… 
Your wife, sir… 
Khurram is amazed.

A soldier escorts Ghazala to Khurram. 
KHURRAM

Ghazala drops on her knees.

I’ll get him to surrender... If you truly love me, give 
me one chance...
She looks at him with pleading eyes, Khurram looks on. 
205 INT. ISLAMIC GRAVEYARD - DIGGER’S HOME 
Arshia still in Haider’s arms. Ghazala’s voice echoes on the 
soundtrack. 
GHAZALA  
(off-screen on megaphone) 
tkuk…- 
My angel!

208
Haider reacts, he slowly gets up and climbs to the window 
to see Ghazala standing near one of the jeeps holding the 
megaphone. They look at each other from afar. 
206 EXT. ISLAMIC GRAVEYARD 
A temporary ceaseﬁre of sorts. Khurram and the Ikhwaans 
keep a close watch as Ghazala walks towards the structure. 
CUT TO: 
207 INT. ISLAMIC GRAVEYARD-DIGGER’S HOME 
Ghazala walks in. Dead bodies of the young Akram and the 
old gravedigger lie on the ﬂoor. 
Haider makes his way down from the staircase, the AK47 
slung across his shoulder. Ghazala looks at him, his face and 
clothes covered in blood. Ghazala breaks down seeing his 
condition. 
GHAZALA

When you were a child I’d tear apart the 
the world… if you got as much as a scratch...
She holds his face in between her palms. 
GHAZALA

You are covered in blood… and I can’t do a thing.
She hugs him and cries. 

209
HAIDER 
ekSts… eSa ljsaMj ugha d:¡xk. 
Mother... I won’t surrender.
Ghazala smiles through her tears. She unties her head scarf 
and begins to drop it at his feet. Haider holds her hand and 
puts the scarf back on her head. 
HAIDER

Not this time. 
GHAZALA

Don’t you want to see me as a widow again?
Haider looks away.

She holds his hand and whispers.

Haider turns around to leave. 
GHAZALA

I beg you… drop your weapons,

He stops, his back faces Ghazala. 
HAIDER

Or else? You’ll kill yourself?

A beat. She turns him around. They look at each other in 
silence. She kisses him on his forehead, eyes and ﬁnally gives 
a soft peck on his bloodied lips. 
CUT TO: 
208 EXT. ISLAMIC GRAVEYARD 
Waiting outside, Khurram is on edge. Finally Ghazala walks 
out, their eyes meet. A beat. She walks towards Khurram, 
and the Ikhwaan soldiers. 
Haider watches through the slit of a window. She is closer 
to Khurram and his army. She stops, her eyes are blank. She 
looks at Khurram, their eyes are locked. She slowly removes 
her shawl. The colour of Khurram’s eyes changes. She wears 
a vest full of explosives joined through multiple wires. A 
small switch attached to the vest, hangs near her ﬁngers. 
Haider screams from inside the house. 
HAIDER 
ekSts!! 
Mother!
Khurram’s eyes dart towards the house. Haider comes out 
and runs to her. Khurram turns back to run. 
Suddenly. BOOM!! She explodes! 
Bodies of Ikhwaan soldiers ﬂy in the air. Others are injured 
badly, there is chaos everywhere. 
Through the ﬁre and smoke emerges Haider - crying 
profusely. 

212
HAIDER 
ekSts!! 
Mother!
As the dust and smoke settle we see a blood-soaked Khurram 
dragging himself along the ground, both his legs blown off. 
Haider’s eyes meet Khurram’s. Crying, he takes out the pistol 
and heads towards the mutilated Khurram. Grabbing him 
by his hair, Haider pulls him up, places the gun on his eyes. 
Blood oozes out of Khurram’s severed legs, he screams 
as Haider tightens his grip. A beat. His mother’s message 
resonates in his mind. 
GHAZALA (voice-over)

beyond revenge… True freedom... 
He suddenly lets go of Khurram. Khurram can’t make sense 
of what just happened as Haider limps away slowly, leaving 
him in a pool of blood. 
KHURRAM 
gSnj! ekj ns eq>s… viuk bard+ke iwjk dj…

Haider! I want to die... Avenge yourself... Kill me...
Haider slowly walks away into the smoke, leaving Khurram 
screaming for mercy. (Option 1- After a few steps he falls 
on the ground. Option 2- Roohdaar emerges from smoke. 
Smiling he opens his arms, Haider falls into his embrace.)
