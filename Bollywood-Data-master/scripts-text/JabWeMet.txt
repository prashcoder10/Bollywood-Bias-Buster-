Corporate Office – Conference Hall
Black screen. 
In the background, a bass note is heard. It is gaining volume, causing unrest. 
Fade-in. Aditya’s face in close. He is staring into the blank. Cut to mid shot. Some movements 
are seen behind him and in front. Cut to mid-long shot. We see a lawyer standing behind Aditya, speaking 
vehemently. Cut to long shot. More movement comes into view. We still hear no sound. Some other men 
in suits are seen, contributing to the tense conversation. Lots of people talking together. Aditya is sitting 
at the head of the table. There is a middle aged woman sitting across the table to him. Raghav, Aditya’s 
colleague, touches his shoulder. Aditya looks at Raghav. Raghav looks cross. Sound fades in – loud, 
incomprehensible din. Chief in that is the woman’s lawyer reading out certain demands from the 
company. 
Lawyer 1
(continuing) …on the other hand you should be happy that my client is not insisting on 
going to court. Although court jaane mein inka fayda hai. Chaar hearings mein baat saaf ho jayegi ki ye 
kya deserve karti hain aur inko is company se kya milna chahiye.
The noise attacks the senses. Aditya sits amidst the madness for a while, then slowly gets up. 
Meanwhile, the noise continues off-camera –
Raghav
I don’t think we should jump to conclusions. 
Lawyer 2
Yahan milne ka matlab yehi hai ki hum Mrs Khanna ki demands ko consider kar rahe 
hain. 
Lawyer 1
Humne aapko consider karne ko nahin kaha hai. Aapki authourity nahin hai consider 
karne ki.
Raghav
Excuse me… hum jhagda karne ke liye nahin mil rahe hain… 
Lawyer Let me tell you that there can be no compromise on the list of demands made by Mrs Khanna.

Corporate Office – Washroom, Corridor
Aditya stands facing the mirror in the wash room. He is looking down. After a moment, he looks 
up towards his eyes. He lacks the courage to look at himself. He looks down. 
He comes out of the washroom, looks at the conference hall. Raghav is standing at the door of the 
conference hall, waiting for him. He indicates to him to hurry back, the others are waiting. Raghav goes 
inside. Aditya looks at the conference hall. Through the glass, he sees Raghav telling the others that 
Aditya is coming back now. Aditya can see that the situation is waiting to explode on him. He stands there 
for a moment. Then instead of going towards the conference hall, Aditya turns right into the staircase.

Corporate Office – Foyer, Porch
Aditya walks into the foyer. The staff and visitors jerk into attention. Some salute, some wish, 
somebody runs towards the porch. 
Aditya’s black BMW drives into the porch. 
Someone opens the car door for Aditya. Aditya walks down the steps, does not go to the open 
door. He walks around and takes the key from the driver and sits in the car.

Evening, Int / Exteriors
Club House Reception Ceremony
The car drives into a club house and parks. Aditya gets off. 

Many men and women – all decked up in fineries – notice Aditya as he walks in. There is a 
reaction of surprise. Aditya comes to the lawn and looks straight. A wedding reception platform, bride and 
groom and guests and photographers. The bride sees him. He is walking towards her. She gets tense. He 
gets into the line of people waiting to meet the couple. 
Aditya gets up on the platform, walks towards the girl, stands in front of her. She looks at the 
groom. The groom extends his hand to Aditya. They shake hands. 
The photographers ask them to pose. Aditya poses. Snap, snap, snap. 
He looks at the bride one more time, then turns and walks away.  
He walks through the corridor, walks into the parking lot and comes to his car. He unlocks the 
car, opens the door. He stands in that position, looking at the keys. Music of receding begins. Aditya 
places the key on top of the car. 
[As he turns away from the bride and walks, ambient sound begins to fade out. By the time he places the 
key on top of the car, the soundtrack is completely silent.]
{1/2 min}
Title Sequence
The music of receding plays. Aditya turns. Titles begin. His mind is a blank, his senses diffused. 
He walks out. 
Outside the club, Aditya walks the lane – as though some force is taking him away. He opens his 
coat buttons and removes the tie. 
Return office traffic has begun. He puts his tie on the pavement, crosses the street.

Aditya walks across a market place.  
He walks on another street. He removes his coat, places it on a railing. A beggar is looking at 
him. He removes his gold cuff-links. Cuff-links fall on the pavement. 
He walks across a bus-stop, pulling his sleeves. A bus stops. People file in from around him. He 
turns and looks at the bus. 
 
He is sitting in the bus. His co-passengers keep changing. 
Evening. The bus comes to a final halt outside VT station. Everyone gets off. Aditya gets out. 
VT railway station. Aditya walks in. 
He walks through the crowd in the foyer.
He is walking on a platform. Train whistle blows, flurry at the platform. Aditya stops. He looks at 
the train. The train begins to move. Aditya looks at the door coming towards him. It is inviting him. He 
moves up and climbs into the door. The train takes him away.  
The train is leaving the station.
[The ambient sound will be almost inaudible. Only very loud and shrill sounds – like the train whistle – 
will be registered. In the last shot of the train leaving the station, the ambient sound will come back in 
full]

Bombay platform, Train
The platform, seen from the train through a door, is moving faster and faster. There are two men 
standing at the door. One of them – a young man, is hanging out and bringing in pieces of luggage from 
someone still on the platform. Evidently, a girl is trying to catch the speeding train. There is a coolie 
involved, but we can only hear them at this time. 
Geet (OC)
Pakdaate jao, pakdaate jao… Bhaisaab ke haat mein do.
One suitcase is already in. It is put on the side by someone. The young man gets off the train and 
takes another suitcase from the coolie and loads it.

Young Man (to Man 1)
Main neeche se pass kar raha hoon. 
Coolie (to Geet)
Tum chahadh jaayo pehle…
Geet (OC)
Arey tum meri tension mat lo, samaan andar karo jaldi… Ye lo… 
The suitcase is in. Man 1 passes it to the next man who passes it to the next. A bag comes in 
now. Then a plastic shopping bag comes in, stuffed with loose items. Then another plastic bag. Then an 
earthen pot with a flower plant. There are a few others who have collected in the door area in the second 
class sleeper to see the drama. Meanwhile –
Coolie (OC)
Hum keh rahe the doo go coolie ka samaan hai…
Geet (OC)
Bag dekho bag dekho girega…
Man 1 
Abhi aur bhi samaan hai?
Young  Man (OC)
Aane do, aane do… 
Geet (OC)
Ye lo, ye padko… Haan…
Man 1 
Bahut riks hai bahut riks hai… Samne dekhiye…
Geet (OC)
Haan dekh rahi hoon, aap jaldi jaldi samaan leejiye… 
Now the young man climbs back in and extends his hand. The girl is pulled up into the running 
train. She clambers in, stands clutching her waist, panting and exhausted. The small gathering is looking 
at her.  
Geet
Oh… Oh teri… Oh god… Aaj to hadd hi ho gayee, line cross hi ho gayee thi aaj to… (She looks 
at all the people in front. She lets out a laugh.) Pata hai kya, aaj tak life mein 
ek train nahin chhooti meri… Thank you Babaji, mera record tootne se bacha 
liya (to Young Man) Aa gayee hoon main andar. Ab to mera haath chhod do. 
(laughs) Itni bhi sundar nahin hoon main.  
Young Man leaves her hand in a spark and looks embarrassed as Geet points towards him and 
laughs.

Passage in the moving train. The girl is walking up holding a bag and ticket, talking to the three 
people who are following her with her luggage. 
Geet
You know, mujhe Non AC mein chalna better lagta hai. Magar meri family… Kehte hain tum 
ladki ho… jaise mujhe hi nahin pata ki main ladki hoon. (to a passenger) Bhai 
saab A2 hain na?
Passenger
Haan…
Geet
Thank you. (to her helpers) Ab AC se ladki ka kya connection hai, ye mere palle nahin pada.

Train Seats
Aditya is sitting on a seat. From the distance, Geet and the other three walk up. Geet is looking at 
the seat number as she walks. 
Geet
I mean koi pehli baari to akele travel kar nahin rahi hoon main… More so is train mein…  Ye to 
samajh lo ki mera second home hai. 
Geet stops, looks at Aditya. She drops her bag, looks at her ticket, looks back at Aditya 
suspiciously. She crosses to face Aditya. 
Geet
Ticket dikhaana please. 
Aditya is looking down, in a trance. 
Geet
Hello… Aap se baat kar rahi hoon. Arey? Ye meri seat hai. Twenty four. Kamaal hai? O boss… 

 She waves her hand in front of his face. He looks up towards her. She thinks he is hearing 
impaired. She mimes, mouthing the words carefully. 
Geet (miming)
Ye seat… chaubis…. Meri…
Aditya looks at her, then gets up and sits on twenty three. He looks away. 
(snip)
Geet is opening her jacket and hanging it in between and talking to Aditya. 
Geet
Ye passage waali seats koi nahin lena chahta, magar main insist karti hoon ki bhaiya passage 
waali seat hi do. Reservation waale uncle bade hairaan pareshaan ho jaate hain magar 
mera funda ye hai ki raaste ke nazdeek rehne… 
(snip)
Geet is adjusting her luggage beneath the lower berth and up on the top berth and talking.
Geet
Mera safar hai na, is train ke saath khatm nahin hota. No. Aage jaana hai mujhe – Bhatinda… 
Mera ghar hai vahan, family hai… Sab ki hoti hai, meri bhi hai… Hai na?
Bhatinde ki sikhni hoon main… 
(snip)
Geet is getting comfortable in the seat now and talking.
Geet
Sab kehte hain Mumbai bada crowded hai. Arey? Crowded matlab kya? Crowd hum jaise logon 
se hi to banta hai? Khud bheed ka hissa hain aur takleef bhi khud hi ko hai. So funny… 
Aditya is sitting on his seat, looking the other way. Geet is another posture. 
Geet (OC)
Main to ja rahi hoon Mumbai chhod ke – hamesha ke liye. Aayee thi pata hai kab, jab 
Mumbai Bombay tha. Ek naam ke shaher mein aayi, doosre naam ke shaher se ja rahi 
hoon… Achcha batao mujhe ye kya logic hui ki… 
(snip)
Aditya is getting uncomfortable with her talking so much. 
Geet (OC)
Hostel, hostel, hostel… St Teresa’s boarding school hostel in Shimla, Missionary Hostel 
for College girls in Bombay Central, Government Girls Hostel on Marine Drive…
(snip)
Aditya is restess.
Geet (OC)
Mujhe kasam hai aaj ke baad kabhi hostel mein nahin rahoongi. Nafrat ho gayee hai 
mujhe hostels se. I hate hostels. I hate them. 
(snip)
Aditya is more restless. 
Geet (OC)
I hope barsaat ke aane se pehle ye roads ki digging band ho jaye varna pata hai kya 
hoga? Anyway mujhe to fark nahin padta kyonki main rahoongi nahin yahan magar jo 
baaki janta hai yahan par…  
Aditya can not take it anymore. He gets up abruptly and walks away. 
Geet (OC)

Train Door, Passage
Aditya opens the door of the train and looks out. The rails are clanging along, bushes are 
jumping out from the darkness, poles are whizzing past. He shuts his eyes for a moment. He hears a siren. 
A train is approaching. He looks at the train. The train charges in, crushing the rails, shaking the gravel. 
Aditya clenches his fists on the railing. There is no one near him. His face is getting hard. The train will 
be there in seconds. It’s a matter of seconds. It is coming. It is about to reach. 
Geet (OC)
Ye kya kar rahe ho?
Aditya gets a start. He turns to look. Geet is standing there, with a towel and soap, come to wash 
her face. He turns to looks at her. 
Geet (OC)
Chalti train ka door kabhi nahin kholte. Pata hai kya ho sakta hai? 
He is looking at her. The train tears past behind him. Geet speaks in animation about a young 
boy who was travelling in the same train as her and had fallen off the door once. But nothing she says can 
be heard because of the loud passing of the train. Yet she speaks with all her might. 
(snip)
Aditya turns away to the night. He closes his eyes and relaxes himself. She is washing her face 
behind him. 
Geet (washing face etc) 
Mook ho, bol nahin sakte? Ya sharmeele type ke ho? Ya sirf budtameez ho? 
Haan? 
Geet shakes her head. Aditya is looking into the night as Geet speaks.

Geet (OC)
Kuch to baat hai. Teen baari main pooch chuki hoon magar koi javaab hi 
nahin. 
TTE (OC)
Ticket please. 
The TTE is standing in front of Geet. Geet’s face is wet.
Geet 
Berth pe hai. Aati hoon. 
The TTE walks up to Aditya.
TTE
Ticket dekhaiye please. 
No response from Aditya. The TTE taps Aditya. Aditya turns. 
TTE
Aur door band kar deejiye. Ticket… 
Geet comes up and begins to mime to Aditya, mouthing what she wants to express. 
Get (miming)
Ye tumhaari ticket dekhna chahte hain… Inhien ticket dikhao. Kahan hai? Ticket? 
Ticket. Tee-ket…

Train Seats
The TTE is sitting, taking out some registers from his pouch. Aditya is sitting in front. Geet is 
sitting on the side. 
Geet
(explaining to the TTE) Actually dekhiye kya hua ki iska plan jo hai na vo aakhri moment pe 
bana. Ticket banane ka time hi nahin tha. Vaise aap ko to pata hi hai 
ki train khaali hai. To aap ab inki ticket bana deejiye, no problem. Hai 
na? Bhaisaab aap convince ho gaye hain ya main aur boloon. 
The TTE gives her a look, then turns to Aditya. 
TTE
Kahan ki ticket banaoon?
Aditya looks back at the TTE. 
TTE
Kahan jaana hai aapne?
Aditya
Ye train kahan jaati hai?
TTE
Kya?
Geet looks at Aditya, then turns to the TTE.
Geet
Last stop. Dilli. Dilli ki ticket banaiye. Dekhiye, main aapko bata hi doo ki – haadsa hua hai inke 
saath. Bura waqt hai. Tab hi ye… Dilli.

The TTE leaves. Geet is looking at Aditya in amazement. She giggles. 

Geet
Kya boss? Chakkar kya hai? Drugs shrugs lee hai? 
Aditya does not reply. She comes closer. 
Geet
Dekho aisa hai ki life mein koi problem hai to mujhe bata sakte ho. I don’t mind. Bata do. Bade 
saare dost mujhe apni problems batate hain aur main unhien solve 
karti hoon, pata hai? Us type ki hoon main – agony aunt hoti hai na, 
magazines mein article aate hain? Vaisi… To batao kya baat hai. 
Bolo. Batao batao, sharmao nahin. Batao kya problem hai. Bolo na.  
Aditya (bursts) 
Tum ho meri problem. Tum… Bolti ja rahi ho, bolti ja rahi ho… Tumhien samajh mein 
nahin aa raha ki main tumse baat karne mein interested nahin hoon? 
Main nahin baat karna chahta tumse. Mujhe nahin janna hai ki tum 
Bhatinda se aayi ho ya Banaras se… ab tak hostel mein rehti thi ya 
brothel mein. Mujhe maaf karo, please. 
He turns away. Silence. He turns back towards her. She is looking at him. 
Geet (calm) 
Brothel vaali baat theek nahin thi. 
He looks at her. 
Aditya
I’m sorry. Really… I’m sorry. Mera vo matlab nahin tha. 
Geet (back to herself)
Main jaanti hoon. Clearly dikh raha hai ki maha upset ho tum kisi baat se. Tab 
hi mujhpar bhi upset ho gaye aur bakwaas karne lage. Magar it’s okay. 
Main bura nahin maan rahi hoon, haan? Actually aaj kal mujhe kisi 
baat ka bura nahin lagta. Pata hai kyon? Kyonki meri shaadi hone 
waali hai. Bahut jaldi. Aur suno, bhaag ke shaadi kar rahi hoon. Vo 
sikh nahin hai na, log manenge nahin. Magar shaadi ho jaane ke baad 
koi kya kar sakta hai? Ja ke pairon pe gir jaana hai unke, maaf to 
karna hi padega. Manali mein rehta hai vo. Shaadi ke baad hum 
pahadon mein rahenge. Mujhe na pahad bahut pasand hain. Really… 
(snip)
Aditya sighs secretly as Geet rambles on. 
Geet (OC)
Ek to ye hill aur mountain ke beech fark kya hai mujhe aaj tak samajh nahin aayi. Bade 
hills mountain hote hain magar kitne bade? Koi aisi measurement hai? 
(snip)
Geet is talking in usual enthusiasm.
Geet
Bachpan se hi na mujhe shadi karne ka craze hai by god. Aur ab to main ruk hi nain sakti. Bas 
wait kar rahi thi ki mera college khatam ho jaye aur uski travel agency 
shuroo ho jaye. 
Aditya sits helplessly.

Geet (OC)
Last few years mein hi hua hai ye sab – trains time par chalne lagi hain aur flights ke 
baare mein to ji jab bhi pata karo to delayed. Kamaal hai, agar humein 
delayed hi jaana hota to flight se kyon jaate?

Train, Small Station Platform 
Geet wakes up at night. She is on the top aisle berth. She mumbles.
Geet
(mumbling) …jab ki na joote achche nahin milte vahan… Tab hi to main…
She rubs her face, looks around. She lifts her head to look out of the window across.  
The train is at a stop. It is a small platform, looks like an unscheduled stop. 
Inside, Geet turns her head to look at the berth below her. Aditya is not there. The train whistle 
blows. She looks up the aisle and down. She is a bit worried. 
(snip)
She gets down the berth, walks down the passage. 
The train has begun to move.  
A man is standing at the footboard as Geet is seen coming out of the compartment near the 
basins. She glances down the platform, then goes towards the toilets. She is back in a flash.
Geet
(to the man at the door) Ek minute bhaisaab. 
She moves to the door as the man moves in. She looks out at the platform in tension. She reacts 
on seeing Aditya. 
Geet
Arey…
We see Aditya. He is walking away in the other direction.  
Geet
(screaming) Oye… Train chhoot rahi hai. 
Aditya does not hear, keeps sauntering away in the other direction. 

Geet
(screaming louder) Arey suno… O hero… Hello…
The man returns to the door, looks out. 
Man
(to Geet) Naam kya hai?
Geet
(screaming) O bhaisaab… 
Man
(to Geet) Bhaisaab naam hai? 
Geet
(screaming) Arey idhar dekho…
Man
(to Geet) Aapke saath hai?
Geet
(to Man in irritation) Arey yaar…
Man
(screaming) O bhaisaab…
The other people on the platform notice the screaming, but not Aditya. He now sits on a bench, 
looking the other way. 
Geet gets off the train, darts a few steps. 
Man
(calling her) O behenji, kya kar rahi hain?
Geet
(screaming) Arey O mister, train chhoot rahi hai. Oye…
He is sitting on the bench. Geet looks at the train, looks at him. She calculates. Then runs 
towards Aditya with all her might, screaming after him. 
Geet
O kaali pant… O Bombay waale, suno… Arey… 
She reaches him, pushes him. He turns to her. 
Geet
Paagal ho tum? Train jaa rahi hai, chalo.
Aditya looks at her, looks at the train, looks back at her, doesn’t move. 
Geet
(stunned) Kya… Maro saale…
She turns and runs back towards the train. She would reach the train. Her compartment has 
passed, but she can get up from some other. The train has picked up speed. She runs at full speed, totally 
focussed on to an open door. So focussed on the door that she does not see something coming in her way. 
Woman (OC)
Arey, arey, arey…
Geet collides and falls and screams. She has hit against a fat, middle-aged woman carrying a 
basket of tomatoes. The woman is on the floor now, tomatoes are rolling in all directions. 
Woman
Arey, dekho to… Dekho kya kar diya… 
Geet orients herself, tries to get up, squishes a tomato and slips. The woman catches her.
Woman
Bhaag rahi hai, iska harjaana kaun bharega?

Geet
Arey chhodo train ja rahi hai
Geet frees herself and moves away, squishing some more tomatoes. The train is bounding away. 
She screams after the train at the top of her voice as she limps forward with all her might. 
Geet
(screaming) Roko… Train ko roko. Arey koi chain kheencho. Roko train ko… Arey…
The train picks up speed and goes away. She runs to a stop at the end of the platform, looking at 
the train in despair. She turns around, panting heavily. She can’t believe this is happening to her. She 
looks at the station. There is a signal boy, some vendors ready to sleep under blankets near their shops – 
everyone looking at her in pity. Except the woman who she had knocked down, who is collecting her 
tomatoes and still abusing. 
Woman (distant) Arey itni moti aurat, itna bada tokra, kisi andhe ko bhi dikh jaaye aur ye paagal… Kya 
jaane kis kis kone mein ghus gaye hain tamatar. (to the people helping her) Arey 
saamne se to main bhi le loongi… udhar waale do…
Geet is at a complete loss. She turns to look at the train again. She looks at the platform again. 
(snip)
Aditya is still sitting on the bench, looking at her as she approaches. She charges in. 
Geet
You bloody weirdo. Kis duniya mein ho tum, haan? Meri train miss kara dee hai tumne. Mera 
saara samaan, sab kuch chala gaya aur main in kapdon mein, slippers pehne, Barnagar 
naam ke station ke is godforsaken platform par khadi hoon aur (loud) ab main kya 
karoongi? Haan?
Aditya
(equally annoyed) Kisne kaha tha tumhein train se utarne ko? Tum apne kaam se kaam nahin 
rakh sakti?
Geet
(loud) O… Meri ghalti hai? Besharam… Main tumhaari help kar rahi thi. Tumhein thank you 
bolna chahiye. Aur tum attitude dikha rahe ho?  
Adita
Okay. Thank you. Thank you ki tumne meri madad karne ki koshish ki. Theek hai? Ab mera 
peecha chhodogi?
Geet
Peecha chhodogi? Achcha… Itna aasaan nahin hai. Tumhaari vajah se meri train miss hui hai to 
ab tum mujhe Bhatinda pahunchaoge, mere ghar tak, aur mere saare saamaan ke saath? 
Ji haan. Main tumhein chhodne waali nahin hoon, koi doubt mat rakhna dil mein. 
Sikhni hoon main Bhatinda ki. 
 
Aditya is looking at her, figuring out the situation. Geet is looking back at Aditya boldly. He 
looks towards the exit of the station, looks back at her. He suddenly turns and runs. 
Geet
(screaming) Arey… Bhaag raha hai… 
She runs after him. He runs up the foot-bridge and goes towards the exit looking at the train 
chugging away in the distance. She is following him with all her might.
Geet
(screaming) Arey padko… Pakdo us aadmi ko. Chor hai, chor… Bhaag raha hai chor, pakdo… 
A guard steps up to Aditya as he is leaving the station gate. 
Guard
Ruk…

Aditya
Hat…
Aditya pushes the guard on the side. The guard looks in distress towards him. Then he looks at 
Geet running in. Geet looks at the guard as she comes up. 
Geet

Geet rushes and sits in the rear of the taxi, understanding Aditya’s plan to chase the train.

Chalo, chalo, chalo. 
Many photographs of deities on the dashboard of the car. The driver folds his hands to them, 
then starts the routine of touching the deity then his eyebrow then lips then eyebrow then lips, another 
diety then eyebrow. Geet is looking impatiently at this.

The train is chugging away at great speed. 
The taxi is rolling away at a comfortably low speed. The driver’s elbow is out on the window and 
he is driving as he must be driving every day. Geet is sitting behind, looking at him in disbelief.
Geet
Ye kya kar rahe ho tum? Aise train pakdenge hum? 
Driver
Train to aap kaise bhi na pakdenge. Ratlam hai agla tesan. Sau kilometre. 
The driver snickers, starts to hum a melodious folk tune as Geet looks at him in desperation. She 
turns to Aditya. 
Geet
(disbelief) He’s mad. He’s totally mad. 
The folk song goes on. 
Aditya
Zara gaadi rokna.

Haan?
Aditya
Gaadi roko.

Aditya gets off the stationery car. 
Driver
Arey kya hua?

Aditya sits into the driver’s seat, the driver gets pushed to the other side. 
Driver
Arey, arey… Ye kya kar rahe hain?
Aditya changes gear. The old ambassador car screeches into motion. 
The driver is startled as Aditya zips the car. 
Driver

He tries to grab the steering wheel but the Geet arrests him from the back seat. 
Geet
Arey disturb mat karo, accident ho jayega.
The driver is stung with nervous anticipation and fear. He petitions to Aditya as Geet speaks to 
pacify him. 
Driver
Mark three… mark three ambassador hai… Ae saab… ae… Arey please… 
Geet
Shh… shh… shh.

Please bol rahe hain… Aap… Eighty… dekho, dekho… Hil rahi hai, hil rahi hai…

of people and things towards the platform. The screaming taxi-driver is after them.
Driver
Roko unko, roko. Bhaag ke kahan jaoge? Ruko…

Ratlam Station Platform
Aditya rushes into the first platform. He sees, stops to gain his breath. Geet rushes in. Sees that 
the train is standing on the platform, right in front of them. Aditya keeps his hand on the A H Wheeler 
stall and dips his head. Geet stops too. She holds her waist and bends, gasps for maximum breath. 
Aditya
Jao andar.
Geet
Aur tum?
Aditya
Dekho. Ab aur meri help mat karna. Please. Apne kaam se…
The driver rushes and collides into Aditya. Aditya almost falls down. 
Driver
(desperate) Mera paisa… paisa do, mera paisa baaki hai.
Aditya
Abey ruk. 
Aditya removes him at an arms length, takes out his wallet. 
Geet comes up as Aditya is taking money out of his wallet and giving to the driver. 
Aditya
Dekho kitna hai…
Geet
Change borrow kar sakti hoon… Paani lena hai. 
Aditya gives her two tens. The driver is sneaking into the wallet. Aditya looks at him crossly. 
Driver
Aur hai na?
Geet
Train mein return karti hoon… 
Geet walks out towards a stall. Meanwhile – 
Aditya
(becoming OC) Tu chup-chaap khada reh, main de raha hoon paise.
A typical Railway Platform stall selling small eats and soft drinks. Two vendors seen inside. The 
one facing looks at Geet as she approaches and puts the money on the deck. She is still exhausted and 
breathless. 
Geet
Paani. 
She picks up a bottle and opens it. The hawker begins to get change. 
Geet
(to vendor) Saans band ho gayee by god. Cola shola sab apni jagah par hai par paani ka kaam 
paani hi karta hai. Kehte hain na – best things in the world are free… Vaise ab paani to 
free raha nahin… Kitne ka hai? 

Vendor (OC)
(returning change) Chaudah rupiya 
Geet
(fight for right mode) Kyon? Railway ke daam to kam hote hain. 
Vendor (OC)
Yehi rate hai… 
Geet
Achcha? Consumer court se poochoon kya rate hai? Hain…? Ulloo banaate ho…? 
Vendor
Do rupiya ke liye itna jhik-jhik? 
Geet
Do rupaye kuch nahin hote to chori kyon kar rahe ho? 
Vendor
Chori…
Geet
Aur kya? Aur kehte ho main jhik-jhik kar rahi hoon? Paise do vaapas. 
The vendor looks at her crossly and makes to give two rupees back to her. Then she takes a gulp. 
The vendor returns a coin and turns to fold up his shop. Geet picks up the change, takes another gulp of 
water and turns. Suddenly, her heart stops. No, this can not be. We see that the train is rushing away. She 
holds her head. There is no chance of catching the train. Then she brings her hands down. She gulps the 
water. The train has almost left the station now. Suddenly, she starts running down the platform.
Geet
(screaming) Roko… Train ko roko. Arey koi chain kheencho. Roko train ko… Arey…
But the train is long gone. Geet runs to a stop at the end of the platform, looking at the train. She 
turns around, stung by disbelief. She just stands, looking straight. This is a much bigger station than the 
other one. Many more hawkers, more people sleeping under blankets. She turns back to look at the train. 
Turns again towards the platform. She holds her forehead with both hands and lowers to her haunches.

Platform, Ratlam Station Master’s Office

A few men standing against the wall, looking the other way. Their look moves, Geet enters. They 
are looking at her. She is in panic. She stops and looks around for Aditya. She whimpers, then turns 
around. 
The station masters office board is seen. She looks around once again, then walks into the office. 
The men who were looking at her move up to the door, peep inside. A few others join them. They are 
whispering to each other about her. 
Inside, Geet is standing in front of the table, very worried. The men peeping inside can be seen at 
a distance behind her. The station master is speaking.
Master (OC)
Kota hai agla station. Main vahan ke station master ko inform kar doonga. 
Master
Vo aapka samaan rakh lenge.
Suddenly, at the door behind her, a young man is pushed inside by the others. He hits against 
something and recoils. Geet turns to look. There is suppressed laughter. The young man darts out. Geet 
turns back.  
Master
Aur to kuch nahin ho sakta hai. 
Geet
(mumbling) Main vahan pahunchoongi kaise? Shit. 
Master
(superior) Kaun bola train se utarne? 
She looks at him. 
Master
Hoshiyar rehna chahiye tha. Ab kya karogi?
He plays percussion on the table with his fingers. As though he is happy that justice has been 
done.
Master
Javani ka josh. Samajhte nahin ho. Nahin. Bilkul nahin. Dekho… 
He holds two of his index fingers parallel to each other. 
Master
(continuing) Zindagi rail ki patri hai. Ek inch ka bend aur aage chal ke meelon ki doori. Ab 
dekho…. Ek choti si bhool tumhaari saari zindagi badal sakti hai.  
He is enjoying this, feeling good to talk. He takes a more comfortable position and continues.
Master
Meri bhi kayee train chhooti hai. Par un dinon main mard tha… matlab ki mard hoon main, ab 
bhi… par tum ladki ho. Akeli ladki khuli hui tijori hoti hai. Tumko pata hai kya ho 
sakta hai tumhaare saath? Pata hai? Main baata hoon. Dekho…
He makes a rectangle with his fingers. 
Geet
Excuse me. 
He looks at her. 
Geet
(polite) Aapse poochhna tha – aap jo ye sab bol rahe hain, iske paise charge karte hai ya ye muft 
ka gyaan hai? 
Master
(puzzled) Nahin ye to muft hai…

Geet
Good… Kyonki chillad nahin hai mere paas. Dekho… Buddhe… Bakwaas band karo 
aur apna kaam karo. Kota ko message bhejo, baaki meri problem hai, main samhaal loongi. Chalo phone 
milao.
The station master is taken aback. He picks up the phone.

Geet sits on a bench. She holds her head. Someone comes and sits next to her. She looks. It is the 
vendor who had sold her water. 
Vendor
Aapka paani.
The vendor is wearing a lungi now. He keeps one foot on the bench. The men hanging around 
the door start moving up towards the bench now. Geet notices this. She looks at the vendor.
Vendor
Bahut bura hua. 
One of the men who were crowding around the door comes in from next to the vendor. The 
others are slowly coming closer.
Man

Vendor

Man

Vendor

Vendor
Haan aur koi upay bhi nahin hai. 
Geet stands up and addresses them more aggressively. 
Geet
Zyada smart banne ki koshish mat karo, samjhe? Chalo niklo yahan se. 
Vendor
Hadd ho gayee. Matlab ki sarafat ka jamaana hi nahin raha.

There is a guffaw in the people around. Geet looks at them. The vendor stands up.

Vendor

The vendor stands in front of her in the posture to get slapped. 
Vendor
Armaan poore kar leejiye aap. Maariye.  
The others are laughing. Geet stares in anger at the vendor and the others. Then she turns and 
walks out. 
Vendor Kya hua? Kahan chaleen? Arey maariye na… Nahin hum to aaj chamaat kha ke hi rahenge.
She walks towards the exit of the platform as they laugh and follow her loosely.

Ratlam Station Façade 
Geet walks out to the foyer of the station. She turns back to look for the urchins. She looks 
towards the street. The taxi driver is there, sitting in his taxi and committing his ritual of touching the 
notes to the feet of the deities, then his eyebrows then lips then eyebrows then lips. She runs towards him. 
He sees her.
Geet
Suno…

The taxi driver panics on seeing her. As she comes down the stairs to him, the car starts and 
flees. She looks at the car sourly. 
Geet
Shit.
She looks back towards the station. The vendor, the man and two others come out towards the 
foyer, looking for her. She notices that a few women are standing to one side of the façade. She walks 
towards them. She stands at a distance from them, feeling safer among her own gender, trying to conjure 
up some sort of a plan. The women look at her. That’s usual. She is new to this place. A motorbike comes 
in, the driver looking shamelessly at the women. He crosses Geet. Then he stops, turns and comes back. 
He stops in front of her. 
Biker
Chal.
Geet looks at him. 
Biker
Kya hua? Chal. 
Geet looks at him in question. 
Biker
Ek aadmi – main. Full night, jagah meri.  
She looks at the women who are standing there in cheap make-up. They are prostitutes. She turns 
sharply to the biker.
Geet
Nahin. Main…
Biker

Geet
Main vo nahin hoon.
Biker

Geet
Vohi…

Haan?
Geet turns and walks back towards the station. 
Biker
Arey yaar… tu bol na paisa main deta hoon. Nakhra kyon dikha rahi hai?
Geet sees the vendor and the other three standing in the foyer, with a panwalla. The man points 
her out to the vendor. Geet stops at the steps. She turns and walks down the steps, the other way. 
Biker
(calling out) O Anarkali. Sun idhar aa.
Geet moves away quickly. The bike comes after her. Geet turns to look at the bike. She turns 
back. She sees something, looks in surprise. It is the figure of a man walking away in the distance.  She 
makes to call, decides against it. The biker reaches her. 
Biker
Sun… 
Geet walks away towards the man. The biker follows her on the bike. 
Biker
Kyon kasrat kara rahi hai raat ko? Paisa bol. Jo bhi hoga main doonga. Ruk ek minute… ruk… 

Geet begins to run. 
Biker
Arey? Ye kya natak kar rahi hai? 
Geet rushes up and overtakes the man and looks at him. It is Aditya. Aditya looks up at her as 
she suddenly appears before him. His jaw drops. And before he can say anything, she springs up and 
embraces him. 
Geet
Thank you babaji thank you. O god. Aaj pata nahin kya hone waala tha. Thank God. Thank you 
thank you thank you. 
Meanwhile, Aditya does not know what the hell is happening. The motorbike drives up. Aditya 
looks at the biker. Biker makes a face at Aditya and turns his bike, goes away. 
Aditya
Phir se train miss kar dee? Haan? Aur ye joker kaun hai bike pe?
She parts from him. 
Geet

Aditya looks at her, takes her hand.

Aditya. Pleased to meet you. Aur itni pleased by god main kisi se mil kar nahin hui jitni abhi

Zindagi bhi kamaal hai, hain na?

Bahut mazaa aa raha hai na? Picnic par aaye hain hum log. Tumhein utha kar museum mein

Geet
Aye hai. Kya baat hai. Aur tumhein kahan rakhna chahiye? Train mein ho magar pata nahin

No credit. Only cash. 
He indicates a small board reading ‘Aaj nagad, kal udhaar’.

Do? Do ghante kaafi honge?
Aditya shrugs.

Achcha chalo safe side teen ghante. (looks at watch) Teen ghante to more than enough hain.

woman. Aur ye dekho (takes out photo from pocket) Anshuman – one and only,

Okay. Ab bathroom mein jao. Aur hamesha hamesha ke liye apni zindagi se ise flush-out kar do.

Hum aisa kyon na karein, ki tum aur main bhaag jaate hain. Shaadi karte hain, aur rehte hain 
pahaadon par. Convenient option hai, dekho. Agar hum abhi Bhatinda nahin jaayen, to

He smiles. He looks behind himself, sees the world he has reached. The smile remains on his

Song # 1
Aditya begins to hum something. Geet and he are sprawled out in the bus stand in Ratlam. Geet 
looks at him. He looks at her, begins to sing the line. There is thin music accompaniment. He gets up to 
sit and sings. 
Music thickens with the the sun rising in Ratlam. The bus is travelling on the state highway and 
Aditya is singing the song. 
The song is about travel. Aditya is going with the flow. He does not know where he will end up 
but he wants to keep going. 
This is the song of a man coming out from the shackles of his life and moving into freedom. Geet 
is the catalyst for this change. 
In the song, Aditya is getting infected by her bright spirit. He is even copying her subconsciously. 
His body language changes in the song. 
After the bus, Aditya is singing as he walks down a street in Kota with Geet. 
In the music interlude, we see that Aditya withdraws cash from an ATM. Then they take Geet’s 
luggage from the station and keep it in the cab he has hired. Aditya is wearing new clothes. 
The car is on the highway now. Aditya and Geet are sleeping in the back seat. 
Geet is seen drawing water from a hand-pump on the way. Both splash water on themselves. 
The car drives through a procession of camels. 
Somewhere on the road, the car’s tyre is punctured, the driver is repairing it. Aditya and Geet are 
sitting on a milestone. 
Then Aditya is driving, Geet is sitting next to him and the driver is sleeping in the back seat. 
At the end of the song, the car is standing at a dhaba somewhere in Punjab. Aditya and Geet are 
climbing a guava tree that is slanted on a water stream on the side of the dhaba.

Guava Tree on Stream
Aditya and Geet are sitting on a branch of the tree, eating guavas. Water is flowing beneath 
them.
Geet
Tum to kamaal ho yaar. Maine apni life mein kisi ko itna achcha gaate huye nahin suna. 
Tumhien to singer hona chahiye. 
Aditya
Sab kuch jo insaan chahta hai, vo milta kahan hai yaar?
Geet
Kyon? Mujhe to lagta hai ki insaan jo kuch bhi real mein chahta hai na, actual mein, usko life 
mein vohi milta hai.  
Aditya
Ek time tha jab main real mein chahta tha, actual mein. Music se bada passion nahin tha meri 
life mein. 
Geet
Life khatam ho chuki hai tumhari? Baat aise kar rahe ho jaise mar chuke ho. 
Aditya
(smiles) Mara to nahin hoon. Magar ab music – vusic nahin ho sakta meri life mein.   
Geet
Kyon?  Kyon nahin ho sakta? Aisi kya majboori hai, batao mujhe. 
He looks down, looks away. 
Geet
O  god. Okay yaar, okay. Mat batao. Magar phir se angry young man mat ban jao, okay?
Aditya
(suddenly bright) Okay. 
Pause.
Geet
Main hi baat shuroo karti hoon. 
Aditya
Of course.
Geet
Hmm… (looks down at the stream) Pani achcha hai na. 
Aditya
Haan.
Geet
(idea) Kabhi kisi ped se neher mein jump lagayee hai tumne?
Aditya turns sharply to her, tries to read her. 
Aditya
(insecure) Geet, chalo ab neeche utarte hain. Come on.
Geet
Try karna chahiye. Bahut mazaa aayega. Chalo. 
Aditya
(serious) Geet, Geet. Main tumse poochna chahta tha. Kabhi psychiatrist ko consult kiya hai 
tumne?
Geet
Oh shut up. 

Aditya
Tumhein zaroorat hai. 
Geet
Bakwaas band karo and jump. 
Aditya
Geet… Listen, relax… 
Geet
Socho, aisa kaam karne ka mauka shayad phir kabhi na mile.
Aditya
Arey karna hi nahin hai aisa kaam. Pagal jaisi baatein mat karo. 
Geet
Tumne bachpana try kiya na? Mazaa aaya na? Ab pagalpan try karo. 
She holds his hand. 
Aditya
Geet suno, Geet really man, Geet…
Geet takes him by his hand and both jump into the water stream with a loud scream. 
They frolic and play in the stream. 
They get out of the water, wearing all their clothes and shoes, shivering.

Dhaba Kitchen
Wet shirts are dumped close to the fire. This is the kitchen area of the dhaba which is the make-
shift changing room for Aditya and Geet. There is a loose partition and Geet is changing, drying on the 
other side. Aditya comes on the front side, looking away. 
Aditya
Idhar dekhna mat.
Geet
Ha ha ha. 
He wears another shirt, begins to dry himself. 
Aditya
Dharamraj Kashyap ka naam suna hai?
Geet
The industrialist? Of course. Jo mar gaya last year. Kyon?
Aditya
Main unka beta hoon. 
Silence. Then Geet appears in front, in shock. 
Geet
(stunned) Tum Aditya… Kashyap ho?
Aditya
Now you know me.
Geet
You are the Kashyap? Vo tumhaari ma thi jo kisi ke saath bhaag gayee thi? 
He flinches. 
Geet
Shit. I’m sorry. 
Aditya
Haan, meri maa thi. Jo bhaag gayee thi kisi ke saath. 
Geet
Vo yaar, news-views mein isi tarah ki language mein suna tha na. Vaise hi nikal gaya. I’m really 
sorry yaar. Really.  
Aditya
No Geet. Mujhe sunna padega. Tum kyon sorry bol rahi ho? Kisi ki ma agar itni cheap hai, itni 
giri hui harkat kar sakti hai to… 
Geet
Mr Kashyap, aapko unke baare mein itni budtameezi se baat nahin karni chahiye.
Aditya
(sudden anger) Kyon nahin karni chahiye, haan? Us aurat ne hamaari family ko destroy kar diya, 
zindagi bhar ke liye mujhe saari duniya ke aage sharminda kar diya, main kyon nahin 
budtameezi se baat karoon?  
Geet
Kyonki vo… pyaar mein thi yaar.
Aditya
(disbelief, bitter smile) Pyaar? Are you serious?  

Geet
Dekho, tumhaari mother hain, unke baare mein ye baatein samajhna mushkil hai, magar usne 
aisa kiya to zaroor us aadmi ke pyaar mein hogi. Aur jab koi pyaar mein hota hai to koi 
sahi-ghalat nahin hota.
Aditya has been staring at her in disbelief.
Aditya
Kisne bataya tumhein ye sab? Kis ghatiya novel mein tumne ye lines padhi hain?
Geet
Sab log kehte hain. All is fair is love.
Aditya
(spite) Jhoot kehte hain sab. It’s all bull-shit. Samjhi tum?
Geet
(promptly, to quell the anger) Samajh gayee.
Silence as Aditya reels in his anger. Then –
Geet
Suno. Tum to bahut hi ameer nikle yaar. Please meri behen ke saath bhaag jao. 
He smiles. 
Geet
Hum sabki life set ho jayegi.
They laugh. 
Dissolve. The sun sets.

Bhatinda House – Façade, Porch

 
The cab drives in the gate of the Bhatinda house. It is an old-styled bungalow on the outskirts of 
Bhatinda. The gardener has opened the gate. He runs after the car as it drives up to the porch. 
(snip)
Geet opens the door. A sikh boy of ten comes running out to the portico and sees Geet. 
Geet
Hi Amrik. 
Amrik turns and runs inside shouting.
Amrik
(calling out) Aa gayee, aa gayee… Geet aa gayee… Tayee ji. 
The gardener begins to take out the luggage, helped by the driver. 
Geet turns to Aditya. He smiles at her. 
Geet
So? Kya plan hai?
Aditya
Dekhta hoon.
She looks at him. 
Geet
Tum mere saath andar chalo. 
Aditya
Nahin. Main chalta hoon. 
Geet
Kahan jaoge?
Aditya
Don’t worry Geet.
Geet
(holding his arm) Nahin, tum andar chalo. Main tumhein aise nahin jaane de sakti. 
Chalo.
Geet’s mother and aunt are seen coming out with a brother and Amrik. 
Aditya
Geet, really. Main nahin aa sakta. Mera… 
Geet
Dekho meri family aa gayee hai. Inke aage scene mat create karna. Tum kuch der yahan raho. 
Main tumse baat karna chahti hoon, uske baad tum chale jaana. 
She quickly turns and gets off the car, going to the ladies.
Geet
Hi mom. Hey sexy aunty…
Sexy

Aditya gets off the car, embarrassed. There is much hugging and kissing with Geet as more

Bhatinda House – Dadaji’s Room

A very old Sikh man is sitting on a chair. There are various portraits hanging on the wall behind 
him. Geet comes up to him. Aditya is brought into the room by Daljit Singh, Geet’s chacha. Her father 
Kulmeet Singh enters too. It is a strict atmosphere.
Geet
(nervous) Paeri-paena dadaji. 
Old Sikh is looking at Aditya. 
Dadaji
Munda kaun hai?
Geet
Ji mera friend hai dadaji.
Dadaji
Kis tarah ka friend hai?
Geet
Dadaji, vaisi koi baat nahin hai.
Dadaji
(scolding) Kaisi baat nahin hai? 
Geet
Matlab… bus friend hai. 
Dadaji
To ghar kyon le aayi hai?
Geet
Vo to aisa hai dadaji ki main ise ghar nahin layee hoon. Ghar ye laaya hai mujhe. Meri na train 
chhoot gayee thi ek station par, raat ko. Agar ye nahin hota na… Aap to jaante ho, akeli 
ladki khuli hui tijori hoti hai. Main ise jaanti bhi nahin thi, train mein hi mile the hum 
log, phir bhi ye mere saath hazaar kilometre tak aaya hai Bhatinda – mujhe safely ghar 
pahunchaane ko. 
Geet’s father and uncle and other middle-aged Sikhs crowd around Aditya, pat his back. Old 
Sikh 
looks at Aditya, back at Geet. 
Dadaji
Aur to koi dosti nahin hai? Kyonki meri umar mein ek jhalak mein dikh jaata hai ki ladke-ladki 
ke beech kya chal raha hai.
Geet
Dadaji please. Aap mujhe sharminda kar rahe ho. 
Dadaji
Sharminda? Agar sharam hoti tere andar to tu is tarah ke kapde pehenti? Ye kapde pehen kar 
ghar aayi hai to Bambai mein to nangi phirti hogi. 
Geet is terribly embarrassed. Old Sikh looks at Aditya. 
Dadaji
Naam kya hai?
Aditya
Ji Aditya.
Kulmeet Singh prompts Aditya to go forward to dadaji. Aditya comes closer. 
Dadaji
Aditya kya?
Aditya
Aditya Kumar.
Aditya bends to touch his feet.

Aditya
Paeri paena. 
Old Sikh catches his shoulder and looks at him. Aditya is caught in mid position. 
Dadaji
Hmmm… Kaam kya karte ho? 
Aditya
Ji main… music ka kaam karta hoon. 
Geet smiles. 
Dadaji
Hum tere karazdaar hain puttar. Toone hamaari ladki ko hifazat se ghar pahuchaya. 
Aditya smiles in the uncomfortable position. 
Dadaji
Ab tujhe ek hafta hamaare saath rehna hai yahan. Taaki hum tera shukriya ada kar sakein. 
Tujhpar ooparwaale ki meher.
Then he pulls Aditya to an embrace.

Bhatinda House – Dining Room
The dining table is a site of forceful hospitality that night. Aditya is surrounded by Geet’s mother 
and aunt and two younger brothers – Satpal and Vikram and two small sisters and Amrik and a very old 
dadi. They form a semi-circle around him. Aditya is guarding his plate with his hands. The dadi wants to 
give him another paratha. 
Aditya
(exhausted) Bas bas… Ab iske baad mera pet phat jayega. 

Amrik
Kya nonsense hai. Kabhi suna hai kisi ka pet phata ho?
Vikram
Infinite elastic ke hote hain pet. 
Geet comes from inside with her father and sees this. Aditya looks at Geet. 
Aditya
(to Geet) Bachao
Geet
Arey, lassi nahin pilayee? Kamaal hai. 
Aditya points a finger at Geet. 
Kulmeet
Haan, ye baat to sahi hai. Koi Punjab aaya hai aur lassi nahin mili. 
Young Girl
Main laati hoon.
Young girl flies off. Aditya gives tough looks to Geet. Geet giggles. Her mother has come up to 
her and she takes her away. Satpal puts more food on the plate. 
Aditya
Arey kya…? Kya kar rahe ho bhai?
Satpal
Aapne hamaari behen ko bachaya hai. Hum itna nahin kar sakte aapke liye?

Daljit
Aap chalo main aapke liye kuch raat ke kapde laata hoon.
Amrik
Aa jao ji.
Aditya walks up, holding the wall – he has eaten so much. 

Aditya
(muttering) O god… Yaar Amrik main to mar jaoonga aise…
Amrik

Suddenly, Geet appears from a room and comes to Aditya. 
Geet

Amrik darts upstairs, Geet takes Aditya’s hand and pulls him into the dark space below the stair-
case. 
Aditya
Kya hua?
Geet
Panga ho gaya yaar.
Aditya
Kya?
Geet
Maine bataya tha na yahan Anshuman ke baare mein koi nahin jaanta? Mummy mujhe baat

Geet stops and looks at the corridor. Her cousin sister Roop is standing outside the staircase 
cavity, looking at them in surprise. 
Roop
Kya kar rahi hai?
Geet
(coming out) Achcha hua tu aa gayee. Aditya, ye meri behen hai Roop. Roop, ye Aditya hai. 
Tujhe iske saath bhaag ke shaadi karni hai.
Aditya comes out of the darkness, trying to hide his embarrassment. 
Roop
Geet, ek second soch liya kar bolne se pehle. Aur andar kya kar rahi thi tu?
Geet
Oh ho possessive… Abhi se jalan hone lagi? Ghabra mat, hum vo nahin kar rahe the. Ye jo hai

Geet laughs. Amrik comes back. 
Amrik

To le jao. Yahan kyon khada kar rakha hai? (to Aditya) Jao. Aur suno. 
She comes close to whisper to Aditya.
Geet

Roop just shakes her head.  
Geet

Behind Bhatinda House
The sun rises in Punjab. The house is still asleep. Geet comes out of the backdoor, makes her way 
towards the tree, reaches it, waits for Aditya, looks around. She sees that Aditya is coming from the other 
side, from the sugarcane plantations. He is shearing and chewing cane and wearing a Punjabi shalwaar 
with mojri and a kurta. Geet smiles, calls out to him.
Geet
Vaari javaan Soniyon.  Ajj tvaada rang-tang kinna kmaal da hai.
 Aditya
Hune tu vekhyai nai ae kuch. Agge agge tu dekh mere rang.
Geet
Hain. Ae te kmaal hai. Tu ta vadi changi punjaabi bolda ae.
Aditya
Ae vi mera ik rang aae.
Geet
Tu kithhe sikkhi inni vadiya Punjabi bolni?

The flow breaks. He continues in Hindi.
Aditya
Meri… mother Punjabi thi. 
Geet
Arey haan. To tum Punjaabi mein baat kyon nahin karte ho? 
Aditya
Aise hi.
Geet
Karni chahiye, pata hai.
Aditya
(looks at her) Yehi chit-chat karne ke liye tumne mujhe paanch baje uthaya hai? 
Geet
(reminded) Arey nahin. Bada panga ho gaya hai.
Aditya
Kya?
Geet
Manjeet aa raha hai.
Aditya
Ab ye saala Manjeet kaun hai?
Geet
Manjeet Khosla. Kuch saal pehle vo log Patiale shift kar gaye the. Mere dadaji aur baaki logon 
ne Manjeet se meri shaadi fix kar dee hai aur vo log aaj aa rahe hain mujhe dekhne. 
Aditya
Hold on. Tumse nahin poocha jayega? Aise hi shaadi ho jayegi?
Geet
Actually, kahaani mein twist hai. 
Aditya
Shuroo karo...
Geet
Ye jo Khosla hain, hamaare bade puraane family friends hain. Manjeet aur main bachpan se 
saath rahe hain. Sab kehte the ki ye dono bade honge to inki shaadi kara denge. Mujhe 
bada mazaa aata tha ye soch kar ki meri shaadi hogi Manjeet ke saath. Ghar-ghar 
khelne mein main kabhi Roop ko Manjeet ki wife nahin banne deti thi. Aath saal ki 
umar mein Manjeet aur main haath pakad kar is ped ke neech khade hote the – ke ji us 
khet ke pare hum apna ghar banaenge. Phir main badi ho gayee, aur is Manjeet episode 
ko as a joke lene lagi. Par kal mujhe pata chala ki mere parents to bade hue hi nahin. Vo 
serious hain. Sab serious hain. Aur meri band baj gayee.
Aditya
To ab?
Geet
Main to bhaag rahi hoon.
Aditya
Arey yaar tu chhootte hi bhaag jaane ki baat karti hai. Aisa sochna bhi mat. Bahut hi ghatiya 
cheez hai ye bhaag jaana. Hazaar tereh ke risk hote hain ismein, aur problems hoti hai. 
Geet
Aur koi option nahin hai. 
Aditya
Hazaar option hain.
Geet
Jaise?

Aditya
Jaise… Apne parents ko – kya naam hai – Anshuman ke baare mein bata do. 
Geet
Vo kabhi nahin maanenge. Ulta emotional blackmail se mujhe yahan phansa lenge.
Bad option. 
Aditya
Agar tum Anshuman ke liye apne parents to nahin mana sakti to bhool jao Anshuman 
ko.
Geet
Next option.
Aditya
Shaadi hi mat karo, kisi se bhi.
Geet
Next
Aditya
Manjeet se Roop ki shaadi karva do.
Geet
Next
Aditya
Court mein saabit kar do ki Manjeet impotent hai.
Geet
Vo impotent nahin hai. Next.
Aditya
Tumhein kaise pata? Ek minute. Manjeet impotent nahin hai, tumhein kaise pata?
Geet
Vo to… pata chal jaata hai. 
Aditya
Pata chal jaata hai? Kahin tumne… uske saath…?

The Khoslas are here. Another pack of turbaned men and long-haired women – of all ages. They 
are being welcomed by the Dhillons. Manjeet Singh Khosla is there too – young, handsome, a touch shy. 
He touches Dadaji’s feet, then of Geet’s father and Chacha. Everyone hugs everyone. Blessings are given, 
foreheads are kissed. 
Aditya is standing across the courtyard, looking at all this. There is a narrow table there on 
which snacks are being laid out. Geet is helping in that. She comes close to Aditya, putting the glasses in 
order. The entire gathering is seen in the background.

He is unclasping her fingers from his kurta.
Aditya
Aur ye saare pehelwaan jo mujhe patak ke maarenge? 
Geet
Thoda bardaasht kar lena mere liye Jaaneman.

The tussle of the fingers and kurta carries on. They are trying to keep their faces straight, but 
cracks of giggles or smles can be seen. 
Aditya
Kurta… kurta chhod, kya kar rahi hai?
Geet
Ye idea achcha ho sakta hai is shaadi ko rokne ke liye. This is the right option.

Geet and Manjeet are walking in the orchard in the backyard. Manjeet is talking, Geet is looking

nayee foundry daal rahe hain, metal strip ki.

Achcha… Hmm. 
Geet  sees Aditya at a distance with Amrik, shooting stones with a catapult.

Haan.

Haan. Peeche hat.

Geet quickly leaves Aditya and turns around to see Manjeet.

Listen, brother. Tumhein ghalatfehmi hui hai.

The figure creeps up to Aditya, who is sleeping on the bed. The person touches him. Aditya

Geet
Shh… Chillana mat.
Aditya lifts himself to sit. Geet comes close. There is enough light to see each other here. They 
talk in low ones and whispers.
Geet
Shh…
Aditya
Yahan kya kar rahi ho?
Geet
Congratulations. Tumne saara kaam kharaab kar diya. Maine itna achcha scene set kiya. Manjeet 
ab tak vapas Patiala pahunch gaya hota. Magar kehta hai mujhse baat karega. Akele

Aditya
Kahan ja rahi ho?
Geet
Kahan matlab? Main bhaag rahi hoon.
Aditya
Geet kabhi aisa mat karna.
Geet
Main aisa kar rahi hoon. Saara kuch planned hai. Tumhein bye bolne aayi hoon.  
Aditya
(sits up more) Tum abhi bhaag rahi ho? As in abhi abhi?
Geet
Haan. Tum yahan rehna kuch din, araam se, phir vaapas Bombay jaana, okay?
Aditya
Ek minute ek minute. Tum bhaag jaogi, aur main yahan rahoonga?
Geet

Aditya
To kal Manjeet apna munh khol dega, aur ye log – jinko pehle se hi shak hai ki tera-mera scene 
chal raha hai – ye apni bhaison ke saath baandh denge mujhe.

Great. To tum bhi chalo mere saath. 
Aditya
Saath gaye to inka shak yakeen mein badal jayega, sochenge tum aur main bhaag gaye hain.

Geet follows Aditya’s look and sees Roop. Roop is straining to see what the hell is happening in

tujhe meri kasam, kisi se kuch kehna mat.

Dekh tu bahut rayta phaela chuki hai, ab main jaisa keh raha hoon, vaisa kar.

He runs towards the gate, pulling her as she tries to argue.

Kyonki kaam maine pitne waala hi kiya hai. (getting serious) Main jaanta hoon ki aap

gaya tha. Aapko javaab dene ke liye Raghav aur maine ek bahut achchi kahaani banayi

bol doon. 
Raghav is looking at Aditya in suspense.

Main bhaag gaya tha… Bina plan kiye main is office se, is sheher se chala gaya. Us waqt mujhe 
ye nahin pata tha ki kahan ja raha hoon, sirf ye maloom tha ki kya peeche chhod raha 
hoon – dad ki death ke baad company ke problems, meri mother ki legal notices, loans, 
girta hua stock… mere kuch personal issues… Mere dimagh ne kaam karna band kar 
diya aur bina soche, bina kisi ko bole, main yahan se nikal gaya, chalta raha aur… in 
short, main bhaag gaya.   
Raghav is looking at the group. They are looking at Aditya – intrigued and in full attention.
Aditya
Aur ye kuch din jo main baahar raha hoon – is duniya se door, anjaan logon mein – ismien 
maine seekh liya ki zindagi utni hi mushkil hoti hai jitni aap usey banaate ho. To main 
vaapas aa gaya hoon, zindagi ko aasaan banaane –  apne liye, aur aapke liye. Mujhe ab 
bhi nahin pata hai ki main kaun se methods use karoonga, magar ye pata hai ki ek 
maheene ke andar is company ki saari problems ko attack kar ke khatam kar doonga 
chahe mujhe kisi bhi extent tak jaana pade. Is waqt mujhe aap ka saath chahiye, aur 
mera vaada hai, ki jab tak main zinda hoon main aapke saath hoon. Aap mein se har ek

khada hoon. Aap sab mere dad ko pyaar karte the. Vo hain kaheen par, dekh rahe hain

Aditya sees that this is Geet’s angry chacha, Daljeet Singh. That is her father, Kulmeet Singh 
and that is her sister Roop. He looks back at Daljeet.
Daljeet
Hum kabhi dhoondh nahin paayenge tujhe? Haan? 
The uncle’s hands are deftly taken away from Aditya’s collar by security guards. He is spun 
around and a baton is placed on his neck. All this before Aditya asks them to stop. 
Aditya

He goes to lift Daljeet.
Aditya

He tries to lift Daljeet. Raghav is looking at the scene in intrigue. Roop and Geet’s father have 
rushed to the uncle. Aditya looks towards them. 
Aditya

Usko yahan bulao. Humein us se baat karni hai. 
Aditya
Chachaji Geet yahan nahin hai. 
Daljeet
To kahan hai?
Aditya
Vo mere saath nahin hai. 
Daljeet Oye bas kar yaar, khatam kar ye drama. Train par mile the hum dono, hain? Kal ke pehle to ek 
doosre ko jaante bhi nahin the. Manjeet ne humein sab bata diya – jo usne tum dono ko 
dekha tha. Roop ne dekha hai tujhe Geet ko bhagaate huye. Aur ab bhi tu samajhta hai 
hum maan jayenge ki vo tere saath nahin hai? Hum kya gaddhe hain? 
Aditya
Chachaji, ek minute meri…
Daljeet Phone uthao, usko bulao yahan. 
Aditya
Main jaanta hoon ki aap logon par aisa impression pada hai ki Geet aur main… saath hai. Magar 
hum saath nahin hain. Kabhi nahin the. 
Daljeet Aur jo toone uske naam se vo Calling Card launch kiya hai? Geet? Saari duniya ke saamne 
announce kiya hai toone. 
Aditya
Vo is liye nahin ki…
Kulmeet holds Aditya’s hand.
Kulmeet (compassionate) Dekho beta, main samjhta hoon ki Geet dari hui hai. Hamaare saamne nahin 
aana chahti.
Daljeet (background, simultaneously) Humein to samajh hi nahin aata kuch. Akal kahan hai humein?
Kulmeet Usne tumhien mana kiya hoga. Par bete jo hona tha vo ho gaya. Ab hum tumhaari shaadi ko 
kabool karne ko taiyyar hain. Tum baat samajh rahe ho?
Roop
Aap Geet ko bolna ki main keh rahi thi. Sab log aapko accept karenge.
Kulmeet Nau maheene ho gaye, uski koi khabar nahin. Tumhein andaaza hai hum kis daur se guzre hain? 
Javaan ladki. Hum do baar Bambai aa kar gaye.
Daljeet (background) Apna naam bhi ghalat bataya tha toone – Aditya Kumar. Humein gumraah karne

Kulmeet To phir kahan hai? Dekho... usey kuch ho to nahin gaya na... matlab ki.. kuch aisi baat hai to vo

Aditya
Nahin, nahin. Aisi koi baat nahin hai. Vo bilkul theek hai.
Roop

Daljeet
Haan, agar vo tere saath nahin hai to tujhe kaise pata vo theek hai?

Mujhe… pata hai. 
Aditya looks at Kulmeet.
Kulmeet

in disbelief. Anshuman has a look of defiance. Aditya speaks after a while –
Aditya
Kaise yaar… Anshuman? Tum aisa kaise kar sakte ho? 
Anshuman
Dekhiye sir… Mujhe guilty feel mat karaiye. Maine nahin bola tha usey ki ghar se 
bhaag aa, samjhe na?
Aditya
To phir kyon bhaag aayee? Apni saari duniya peechhe chhod kar tumhaare paas kyon aa gayee 
vo?  

Anshuman
Kyonki uska dimagh kharaab hai. Aap usey jaante hain to ye bhi jaante honge ki 
bachpana kitna bhara hua hai uske andar. Sapnon ki duniya mein rehti hai. Samajhti hai 
hamesha vaisa hi hoga jaisa vo chahti hai. 
Aditya
To tumne ye saabit kar diya ki actually ye uske sapnon ki duniya nahin hai, kyonki is mein tum 
jaise log rehte hain.
Anshuman looks sharply at Aditya. Then –
Anshuman
Dekhiye, dialogue maarna asaan hai. Meri situation kya hai, vo main jaanta hoon. Main 
rehta hoon yahan. Mere ghar waale hain, society hai, kaam-dhandha hai aur hazaar 
tereh ki tension hai. Ek din, achanak, vo yahan land hoti hai aur kehti hai ki chalo hum 
abhi shaadi kar lete hain. Abhi, isi waqt. To aapke hisaab se mujhe kya karna chahiye 
tha? 
Aditya
Depend karte hai ki tum us se pyaar karte ho na nahin. 
Anshuman
(smirks) Ye to height hai. Dekhiye, aap bahut bade aadmi hain, magar main aapke 
saamne apne pyaar ka imtihan dene waala nahin hoon, samjhe na?  
Aditya
Zaroorat bhi nahin hai. Agar tumne uski zindagi barbaad kar dee hai to ye to clear hai ki tum 
uske baare mein kya feel karte ho. 
Anshuman
Magar ye clear nahin hai ki aap uske baare mein kya feel karte hain? Geet ne to kabhi 
kaha nahin ki aapko jaanti hai. Phir bhi aap uske peeche itni door chale aaye. (smirks) 
Scene kya hai boss? Haan?
Aditya
Geet aur mera scene main tumhein zaroor batata Anshuman, magar tumhaare jaisa cheap aadmi 
ye baat samajh nahin payega. 
Anshuman
Kya? Kya kaha?
Aditya
Cheap, ghatiya, gira hua.
Aditya stands to leave. 
Anshuman
Dekho, limit mein raho, samjhe na? Kya gira hua hoon main? Maine us sey shaadi ka 
vaada kiya tha kya? Shaadi ka naam bhi nahin liya tha maine. Bhoot us par savaar tha – 
shaadi ke baad ye karenge, vo karenge – aisa ghar, vaisi balcony, aise parde. Bewakoof. 
Maine bola usey – chali ja vaapas Bhatinda. Shimla se phone karti thi to bhi main yehi 
kehta tha. Magar baat to sunni nahin hai. To jhelo phir. Mujhe kya fark padta hai? 
Aditya
Geet nau maheene se ghar nahin aayee hai. Nau maheene se. Akeli hai kaheen par. Pata nahin 
kya kya beeta hai uspar… kaise kaise din dekhe hain usne, kis situation mein hai. 
Tumhaari vajah se. 
Anshuman is silent. 
Aditya
Tumhein fark nahin padta hai tab to theek hua Geet ke saath. Usko saza milni chahiye ki usne 
tumhaare jaise aadmi ko itna zyaada pyaar kiya. 

Anshuman is silent. Aditya is looking at him.

Song # 5
Geet waves from a distance and runs down into the open cafeteria. Anshuman stands and walks 
up, decided to turn her away. Geet reaches him, bustling with excitement. We are seeing her as he begins 
to talk and scold her. Her happiness begins to fade away. The lyrics of the song begin. She stares at 
Anshuman as her face changes to disbelief. She is stunned for a while, then she speaks. She is cut short. 
Tears come to her eyes. She begins to plead. She is asked to go away. She pleads some more. Anshuman 
walks away. She stands there for a while, tears flowing down her cheek. Then she slowly turns and walks 
back the way she had come. She climbs up the steps. 
She is sitting on a bench at the place where Aditya had dropped her. 
Evening time, she is seen walking up towards a hotel. 
The next day, she is walking up a lane in Manali. She sees Anshuman walking up in her 
direction. Her heart begins to beat aloud. She walks towards him. Anshuman is talking to another man. 
He sees her as she comes close, then he just looks away and crosses her, walks away. Geet is hurt to 
numbness. She stands there for a long time, cheek burning in shame. Then she walks back. 

Geet walks out of the hotel with her bag, numb. She walks into a bus stand. She gets on a bus. 
The bus is going to Shimla. She sits silently in the bus. 
Shimla bus stand. She is sitting on the platform, her mind blank. A nun comes to her, having 
recognized her. She used to teach the Geet at Jesus and Mary convent in Shimla. She talks to Geet, asks 
what the problem is. 
The nun walks Geet into a YWCA hostel. 
Geet is moving into a room in the hostel. 
The nun takes Geet to the Jesus and Mary convent. Geet enters the principal’s room. Mother 
superior takes Geet to the school library where she begins work as the librarian. 
 
She calls Anshuman a few times. He cuts her off. And her life goes on in a lonely and miserable 
manner. She is struggling to keep her hope alive. Hostel, school, some lonely corners of the city.
And one day, as she is walking up to school, we see that Aditya walks up in the distance, looking 
at her. He has found her. But he does not go up to her immediately. He trails her at a distance for the day. 
She looks like the ghost of the girl Aditya knew. He is so sensitive to her right now that if she stumbles a 
bit while walking, he tends to leap out and hold her. But he does not do that. Finally, she walks up 
towards her hostel. She sees Aditya sitting there.

Okay. Dhyaan mein rakhoonga. Ab chalo.

Tumko vajah batana zaroori nahin hai. Apna samaan le kar aayo tum. 
Geet
Nahin Aditya. Main tumse aur ehsaan nahin le sakti. Tumne pehle hi bahut kuch kiya hua mere 
liye aur…
Aditya
Maine bahut kuch kiya hai tumhaare liye? Maine bahut kuch kiya hai? 
He pauses, looking at her. 
Aditya
Main aaj zinda tumhaari vajah se hoon, you fool. Ye jo aaj main tumhaare saamne khada hoon, 
ye meri doosri zindagi hai, jo tumne mujhe dee hai. Tumko pata hai ki aaj main bahut 

successful hoon? Aaj company ki vo value hai jo Dad ke waqt bhi nahin thi. Teen nayee 
industries shuroo kee hai maine, kayee brands launch kiye hain, sab kamaal ka business 
kar rahe hain aur jo kuch bhi main hoon vo sirf tumhaari vajah se hoon. Har situation

He stops himself. Pause.

Ab chalogi? Ya aur drama karna hai – chale jao, meri zindagi hai, kya samajhte ho apne aap

Oh teri ki… Oh god… Kitni gaddhi thi main. Kitni badi bewakoof thi. Tab hi to ye sab ho raha

He looks at her. The smiles disappears from his face. She shakes her head as her face begins to 
contort with the weeping that is coming.

Tum jitna bhi ro lo, tadap lo, vo vaapas nahin aayega Geet. Usko aana hota to bahut pehle aa

He moves to the food trolley. Begins to eat. 
Aditya
Aur kal tum mujhe Shimla ghumaogi, samjhi? 
She nods, still awkward. 
Aditya
Embarace mat ho, bhool ja. Ki hoya tha itthe? Kuch bhi nahin. 
She smiles. 
Aditya
Aa ja, rotti-shotti kha le. Kal khaasi maint kaarni hai. 
Geet moves towards him. 
Aditya
Aa ki order kitta? Ae koi khaanh di cheez ae? Kuch pneer-shneer de tikke mngaa, koi kukkdi-

She is laughing as they eat together.

The sun rises in shimla. The city is waking up.  
Aditya’s car drives up to a spot and stops. Aditya is looking out at something, geeting charged 
up. Geet follows his look. They look at each other in excitement. Aditya turns away, quickly switches the 
car off, opens his seat-belt in a hurry. Geet smiles, follows suit. She gets out of the car. 
Aditya is running ahead, locks his car with the remote. 
They run, down a passage, through a footbridge, come to a railway station and run after the toy 
train that is leaving the platform. Aditya runs and gets on the train. Geet runs and runs and this time she 
catches the train. 
She is laughing. 
Geet
Pata hai? Mujhe darawne sapne aate hain, kayee maheenon se, ki main na train ke peeche bhaag 
rahi hoon, aur train chhoot gayee. 
Aditya
Aaj pakad liya na?
Geet
(happily) Haan.
They have sat down by now. She is looking at him. Both are out of breath. 
Geet
Main tujhein bahut achchi lagti hoon na?
Aditya
(point blank) Bahut. Bahut zyada achchi lagti hai. Magar vo mera maamla hai. Mujhe apni 
feelings par poora haq hai. Hai ki nahin? 
She nods. 
Aditya
Aur tension mat le. Tujhpar koi pressure nahin hai, theek hai? Theek hai? 
She nods. He mock punches her face tenderly. She does the same. Then he does a karate action. 
She laughs, does a karate action too.

Shimla – Hotel

The lobby of Aditya’s hotel. Aditya and Geet enter the lobby. I feel so hungry in the hills, he is 
saying. You want to grab a quick bite? Are you mad, she says. I can hardly breathe. Stop thinking about it, 
he says. I’m not thinking, she says. You have to think. I’ll just close my eyes and follow you. We see that 
Anshuman is sitting in the lobby, waiting for them. He turns and sees them. He gets up and moves 
towards Geet. Aditya, telling Geet that they should leave in a couple of hours, sees Anshuman. He stops. 
Anshuman walks up. Geet looks at him. Anshuman walks up, straight to Geet. Geet is stunned. 
Anshuman is now standing in front of her. Geet, Anshuman begins. I messed up. I really messed up. 
When you spoke to me last night… when you used all those words… it just opened my eyes… What was I 
doing? I was trying to forget about you, but it wasn’t possible. Anshuman looks at Aditya. It was too 
sudden for me, Anshuman continues. She just landed up in Manali that day and I could not handle it… 
Anshuman looks at Geet now. I did not have the courage to take you to my house. But today I care a damn 
for the world. I have come to take you back and I promise I will never… never hurt you again. I am sorry 
Geet. Geet stares at him. I am sorry Geet, Anshuman is saying. I’m sorry.

Shimla – Hotel Corner
Aditya is standing reclined on the back of the couch. He is in deep introspection. After a while, 
footsteps are heard and Geet comes in. He looks at her. Her eyes are red with tears. I can’t believe this, 
she says. He leaves me on the streets one day and nine months later he comes and says sorry. Just like 
that. Is it so simple? How can I forget and forgive him so easily? Don’t forgive him, he says. Trouble him. 
Take your revenge. You have your lifetime to do that. She looks at him. You know Geet, he says. My 
parents did not love each other. They loved other people. And my entire life I have suffered because of 
that. They were great together in the office, but home was hell. They should have just followed their 
hearts and sooner or later everything would have sorted out, isn’t it? Geet is looking at him. This man has 
caused you pain, Aditya continues. He took too much time, you suffered, so punish him as you see fit. But 
don’t turn him away. That will be a mistake. I can’t believe, Geet says, that you are arguing his case. 
Aditya smiles, he touches her head. I am arguing your case too Geet, he says. Both your cases are the 
same. It’s simple – you love each other so you need to be together. That’s how everyone will be happy. 
She is looking at him. And you, she asks. What about you? Well, he says. You have your first extra-
marital affair with me, then I’ll be happy too. She smiles. He smiles. The smiles fade away. No Aditya, 
she says. I can’t do this. Follow your heart Geet, he says. Everything will sort out. Pause. He extends his 
hand. Music of Song # 6 begins. Geet gives him her hand. She is looking at him. He smiles at her.

back into the room. He stands against the wall. 
 

Early morning in the mountains. Two cars are driving down. Aditya is driving the one in front. 
Anshuman is sitting next to him. Geet is in the rear seat. She is looking at Aditya. Aditya notices her. He 
smiles at her in the rear view mirror. The journey continues. The car approaches the house at Bhatinda,

Bhatinda House – Drive, Façade, Courtyard, Hall
The gardener runs up to open the gate. He is very happy, is trying to peer inside the car. Aditya 
looks at Geet in the rear-view mirror. She is very nervous. Anshuman is looking out of the window at the 
house. All the best, Aditya tells Geet. They are here, they are here, Amrik shouts as he runs inside after 
seeing them. Aditya drives inside. He sees that the porch is decorated with flowers. People spill out into 
the verandah from inside. It is a huge gathering. Apart from the family, there seem to be relatives, friends 
– all wearing good clothes, in celebration mode. Geet’s brothers are there. They herd the car into the 
courtyard. Geet is sitting in the rear, tears coming to her eyes. Anshuman is surprised by the ambience. 

What’s happening here, Anshuman asks. Their girl is coming back after nine months, Aditya says. The 
car stops in the courtyard. The gathering moves towards the car. Aditya looks at Geet. Anshuman is 
looking around in surprise. Roop rushes to the door and pulls Geet out. She embraces Geet, sobbing. 
Geet’s mother comes to her, embraces her. Geet is sobbing too. The swarm of people envelope Geet. 
Everyone hugs her, everyone kisses her, everyone asks her not to cry as she is moved up the stairs into the 
verandah. Angry uncle comes towards Aditya. He opens his door and brings him out. He has tears in his 
eyes. He embraces Aditya. Thank you, he is saying. Thank you son. I had not believed you when you said 
you will get her. But you did. We will never forget this. He takes Aditya’s hand and brings him to the 
veranda. Aditya meets Geet’s father. Roop rushes in with a flower garland and puts it around Aditya’s 
neck. Kyon jijaji, she says. Aditya looks up sharply at Roop. He looks around at everyone. The situation 
hits him. He looks towards Geet. Geet is with her mother and others. They are wiping her tears. Roop 
turns Aditya’s face to herself. What happened, she says. Can’t take your eyes off her, haan? She pulls 
Geet next to him. Happy now, she asks. Geet is looking at Roop in question. Arey Roop tu hat, Sexy Aunt 
says. Let us see them together. A swarm of ladies with expectant eyes moves into position to see Aditya 
and Geet together. How nice they look together, the older ones say. Made for each other. Some people 
start circling money around their heads to protect from any ‘nazar’. It dawns upon Geet. She is frozen. 
She looks at Aditya. Aditya looks at her. They stand there, stumped. Aditya looks towards Anshuman. 
Anshuman is still in the car. He is gaping at what is happening. Angry chacha follows Aditya’s look. 
Arey, get that boy also, he orders. Geet’s younger brothers run towards Anshuman, opens the door of the 
car. He is your friend, chacha asks Aditya. Aditya looks at him, nods. The boys run Anshuman up the 
steps of the porch. Come beta, welcome, says angry chacha. Anshuman just looks at him. Then he looks at 
Geet and Aditya. By now, Geet’s mother had made her way in front of Geet and Aditya with a thali of 
sweets. She picks up a sweet and makes Aditya take a bite. Then she brings the remainder of the sweet to 
Geet’s mouth. Love increases by eating ‘jootha’, she says. Aditya looks at Anshuman. The sweet is in 
front of Geet’s face. Mother puts it into her mouth. Anshuman does not know what the bloody hell is 
happening out here. His hands are in the question mark positions. Aditya is looking at him. But Geet’s 
mother kisses him on the forehead. He looks at Geet. He gets his mouth close to her ear. Tell them fast, 
Aditya is saying. Yes, Geet says. Ae, kya ho raha hai, Roop and the other saalis scream. Aditya looks at 
Roop, smiles. Ma, Geet turns to her mother and says. Come in, mother says. Come. Aditya and Geet are 
taken into the hall. And it’s not a simple going in – it’s the ritual of entering house. Enter together, 
mother is saying. They make to step in through the threshold. Not like this, Roop says. You had gone 
holding hands. So you will have to hold hands as you enter. Anshuman is looking at Roop, now he looks 
at Geet and Aditya. Aaj badi sharam aa rahi hai, Roop says to Aditya and Geet and makes them hold 
hands. Geet looks at Aditya, as though apologizing. He knows that she needs support at this time. They 
step in together. There is massive clapping and rejoicing. Geet is still clutching Aditya’s hand. Anshuman 
comes in. Aditya makes to release his hand. Geet realizes that she has to let go. She turns to her mother. 
Ma I have to talk to you, she says. Come… First meet Darji, mother says, then there is a long booking 
with all the relatives and friends. Come, she says. Roop, take them. Aditya and Geet are taken away. 
Mother looks at Anshuman. You also come bete, she tells Anshuman. Anshuman’s face is blank. He nods.

comes forward. One minute, says old sikh. Aditya stops. Old sikh looks at Geet and Aditya. He looks 
carefully. The very first time I saw him, I had understood, he says to Geet. At my age one glance tells you 
what is happening between a girl and a boy. Aditya looks at Anshuman. Anshuman is trying to follow 
what old sikh is saying. Old sikh continues to Geet – I asked you. But you lied to me. And it must have 
been your idea to run away, wasn’t it? Wasn’t it? Geet nods. See, he tells the others. I knew it… She is the 

naughty one between the two. Anyway, I have heard that the world has moved ahead and times have 
become very modern. Everyone wants to accept both of you and I will agree with them. But remember – 
you have made your mistake and got your pardon. Now no more surprises and no more shocks. Okay..? 
Angry chacha indicates Aditya to touch old sikh’s feet. Aditya touches his feet. Old sikh catches Aditya’s 
shoulder. Aditya is caught in mid position. Handle her with care, old sikh says. Aditya nods. She is the 
naughtiest one in the family. She has troubled us a lot. She will not spare you too. If she does some hanky-

take our photo. The others move out. All the kids cramp in around Geet and Aditya. Anshuman is there is

a shrug. Aditya whispers to Geet – Should I tell your father? He indicates to Anshuman to wait. Hilo mat, 
hilo mat, Amrik is shouting. He takes the snap. No, Geet says then. I will tell my mom. She is coming. 
One minute, one minute, Amrik says as he rushes in. He wants to be in the snap too. There are so many 
people here, Geet is saying, nervous. Amrik has come to Anshuman in the mean time. You take the photo 
na, Amrik says. He gives the camera to Anshuman. Anshuman looks at the camera as if it is a dead frog. 
Open the lens, Amrik says quickly, then press the flash on and click… simple. Come… He takes 
Anshuman to the spot to click, then rushes back into the snap, next to Aditya. Ready… The group is 
posed. Come on click, Amrik says. Anshuman raises the camera with reluctant hands, tries to click. Again 
tries to click. It is not clicking, he complains. Show, Amrik runs to him. He takes the camera. Arey, he 
says hitting his palm on his forehead. You have not switched on the flash na… Now click. Ready. 

Anshuman clicks. Geet’s mother and father come in. Achcha all this later, mother announces busily. The 
kids run away, snatching the camera from Anshuman. Father takes Aditya’s hand. Come beta… I want 
you to meet everyone. Aditya looks at Geet. Geet nods slightly as Aditya goes away. She turns to her 
mother. Let’s go inside ma, Geet tells her, I have to… Mother is looking at Anshuman. He is coming in 
everyone’s way. Ma listen, Geet says. Beta, mother says to Anshuman, why don’t you go and freshen up, 
she tells him. No, I am fresh, Anshuman says. Arey you have had such a long journey, mother says. 
Samar, take him to the room… give him towel and soap… Go beta… Anshuman is making slight protests 
but the two brothers catch him and rush him down the corridor… Aao ji, aao ji… He is turning back to 
look at Geet, but soon he is gone. 
All the relatives are in the courtyard. Geet’s father is introducing Aditya to each one of them. 
Aur ye Arjan Singhji hain, her father is telling Aditya. Patiale mein rehte hain. Mujhse ek saal chhote

Aditya laughs, looks towards Geet. Geet is broght to sit on the diwn by the other women. Geet looks at 
him. Aditya raises his eyebrows to her. She turns to her mother. Ma, she says. Yes beta, ma says. We have 
to talk. There is so much to talk about. Nine months. But tell me – you are fine na? Yes ma, Geet says. I 
am absolutely fine. Aditya treats you well, ma asks. Geet looks at her mother. What, mother asks in 
concern. He treats me well, Geet says plainly. Is there something wrong, mother asks, her concern 
growing. He behaves badly with  you? Ma, Geet says. He treats me like even you have never treated me. 
Mother hugs Geet in relief and happiness. He really loves you na beta, ma asks. Yes ma, Geet says. That’s 
not the thing. Mother is looking at Geet. Let’s go inside, Geet says. Yeah come, mother says. But in the 
mean time, Roop and the other girls come to Aditya and grab him. Meet us also jijaji, Roop says, pulling 
him to where Geet and the other women are. Roop continues – and tell me why you betrayed me. She 
seats Aditya next to Geet. Mother looks at all this with a smile. You had to run away with me, Roop 
continues, and you ran away with my sister instead? How could you do this to me? Tell me. All the girls 
are giggling. I could not make out in the dark, Aditya says. I thought it was you… but in the morning I 
discovered that it was Geet. All the girls titter. Such bad luck, Roop says. And who is the sample you have 
brought along? Who, Aditya asks. Your friend, Roop says. He is my compensation package or what…? 
Aditya can not help but laugh. He looks at Geet. He shakes his head. Geet takes her mom’s hand and 
makes to get up. Geet’s father comes up. Move, let me also sit, he says. He sits next to Aditya. Beta, he 
addresses Aditya. We want to have a small marriage ceremony at the Gurudwara, with our customs. See 
your marriage has happened, but this is just for our satisfaction… and to properly introduce you to our 
community. Aditya looks at Geet. Geet looks at him. Don’t look at her, father says. Tell me honestly. We 
won’t do it if you have a problem. Geet turns and walks away, surrounded by many aunts and cousins. I 
have no problem, Aditya says. Very good, mother says, turns and goes after Geet. We will have the

None of this would have happened. How strange… They are doing all the ceremonies with you and

I will take her away from them and talk, Anshuman says. But Anshuman people here think you are my

Then – Arey, he exclaims. What will they think? Let them think – that is the truth, no? She and I is the

happened in the last twenty-four hours. My mind is all jammed. Anyway, good you came, Aditya says. 
Anshuman is desperate to meet you… Geet sees that Anshuman is sleeping on the bed. Aditya moves to 
wake him up. I could have told ma, or papa, she says. Aditya stops. I got the chances, she continues, but I

I am not thinking of them at all, Geet says. I am thinking about myself. I don’t know what I really want. 
She looks at Aditya. I have put you in a mess, haven’t I, she asks. Don’t play the nice, sensitive girl on

to leave in the morning. Geet’s face changes. You are going, she asks. Suddenly, there is loud knocking 
on the door. Geet, Roop’s voice is heard along with the titter of other girls. Anshuman wakes with a start. 
I am coming in, Roop is saying. What’s happening, Anshuman asks. Roop has entered with two other 
girls. What is happening here, Roop demands with mock athourity. Roop one minute, Geet says. Let us 
talk. Roop comes and holds Geet to take her away. Mother said no, she is saying to Aditya, no together at 
nights before Anand karaj? Someone has kept the right name for your types, Aditya says. You deserve to 
be called saali. You have ditched me jijaji, Roop says. I will torment you all your life now. Come Geet. 
Roop looks at Anshuman. He gets up from the bed, looking at them in confusion. Oh, Roop says. He is

Behind Bhatinda House / Backyard
The sun rises in Punjab. The house is still asleep. Geet comes out of the back door, makes her 
way to the tree where she had met Aditya nine months back. Aditya and Anshuman are sitting there. 
Aditya gets up on seeing Geet and walks towards the house. Hi, he says as he crosses her. When are you 
leaving, she asks. Soon, he says. They will not let you go, she says. This time I won’t stop, he says. He 
smiles, walks away. She looks at him go for a moment. Anshuman comes to her. Geet, he says. This is 
completely absurd yaar… Why don’t you tell them, what is the matter with you? She looks at him. It’s not 
at all complicated Geet, he says. All you have to do, he explains systematically, is to tell your mother, or 
anyone… that yes you are in love, and you will get married… only not with Aditya, but with Anshuman. 
Whatever the plan is can go on without a hitch, everyone can remain as happy as they are, only Aditya 
has to be replaced by Anshuman. Simple. She looks at him. Once you tell them this, they will ask a 
thousand questions – arey, howcome, this that… And you tell them the answers – How you met me… 
How you were at the hostel in Bombay and how I used to come with my friend to meet his girlfriend… 
Remember that evening… you were coming down the steps when you met me for the first time… Tell 
them how we started going out without our friends… alone… How we used to sit on Marine Drive for 
hours… Tell them about that evening, on the way back from Elephanta… How we had stood on the 

streamer. Anshuman goes on talking, but gradually, Geet stops hearing him. Anshuman’s mouth is 
moving but there is no sound. Geet is staring at him, but not seeing him any more. Her mind is elsewhere. 
Flash of the train. Geet sees Aditya for the first time. He is sitting on her seat, looking down.
Geet is standing in front of Anshuman outside her house in Bhatinda. 
Outside Ratlam railway station. Geet hugs Aditya, relieved to have him there. 
Geet parts with Aditya in Manali. 
Geet flings herself on Aditya after she had abused Anshuman on the phone. He holds her and his 
back comes against the wall. He holds her waist for balance, runs his hands on her sides, she lifts her face

Geet, in the present time, turns abruptly and starts walking back to the house. Anshuman stops 
his talk, surprised. Geet, he calls out. You are going right now…? Geet does not reply, she moves away. 
Wait, I’m coming too, he says, coming after her. Geet rushes, she runs. She enters the house, comes to the 
backyard, rushes up, looking around. She sees Aditya in the backyard. He is with Amrik, teaching him to 
fire air-rifle. Geet rushes up and reaches Aditya. Aditya looks at her. What happened, Aditya asks. Geet is 
tense, her breath is up. What happened, he asks again. Is he coming, Geet asks. Who, he asks. Anshuman, 
she says. Is he coming? Yes, he says. Is he looking this side, she asks. Yes, Aditya says. Geet flings 
herself on Aditya. She holds him and this time she is holding nothing back. Anshuman freezes on his 
tracks. He sees Geet and Aditya. He is shocked. What is the meaning of this? But he is not as shocked as 
Aditya. Aditya’s mind is racing, not coming to any result. Geet faces Aditya. The one favour you have 
done for me, which I can never repay you for, is bringing Anshuman back, she tells Aditya. Otherwise I 
would never have known what I truly feel. Aditya stares at her in disbelief. I am going to follow my heart 
now Aditya, she says. And everything will sort out. She kisses him. He holds her and kisses her. He kisses 
her with the anguish of all the times when he had stopped himself from kissing her. The kid is looking at 
them with a wide grin as they kiss right in front of his eyes. Anshuman turns away, holds his head in 
grievous bewilderment. Geet and Aditya stand together in the backyard. They will always be together 
now. Nothing can separate them.

Bhatinda House – Dadaji’s Room
Flash-forward. Ten years later. Geet and Aditya are sitting on a couch. Their two sons are with 
them. Old Sikh, very old now, is lying on the bed and looking at them. Bachchon, very old sikh is saying. 
Tere ma-baap bade shaitaan hain. Inhone baar-baar jhooth bola ki inke beech kuch nahin hai. Magar 
maine pehli nazar mein pakad liya tha ki ye premi hain, hai ki nahin? Haanji dadaji, Aditya says. Aur 
dekho, vohi sach nikla ki nahin? Haanji, dadaji, Geet says. Geet and Aditya are holding hands behind 
their children, looking at each other and smiling secretly as very old sikh continues – Arey bachche, 
hamaari umar mein waqt nahin lagta. Ek jhalak kaafi hoti hai ye pehchaanne ke liye ki… 
Song # 7
And in the present time in Bhatinda, the nagada plays and the hands clap and voices sing and the 
rituals take place and the sweets are eaten and the gifts pile up. Cars come in from Bombay with Raghav 
and Aditya’s mother. Aditya walks up, rushes and hugs his mother. His mother holds him dearly, crying. 
Geet’s mother comes and hugs her. Aditya’s mother sees Geet. She gives her necklace, her ear-rings and 
all her gold bangles to her, crying. Then she starts dancing with Geet’s mother, in the Punjabi style that is 
common to both. And how they dance. And father dances and the uncle dances and the aunty dances and 

the saali dances and kids dance and the elders dance. End titles begin on the celebration as things go 
completely improvised. 
Geet and Aditya are dancing in high-speed, looking at each other in the crowd. Fade-out.
