Fade in. A Jordan impersonator – strumming the guitar, singing a Jordan song. 
He is wearing the clothes and attitude of Jordan, and a wig for his hair.  
‘Jo bhi main… kehna chahoon…”.  
Back to back with him is another Jordan impersonator, strumming the guitar 
and singing the same song.  
Bright, cheerful folks sitting around the two singers in the lawn, clapping, 
cheering, singing along.  
A street painting of Jordan – around which fans are sitting. A girl stretches 
across and kisses Jordan’s painting.  
 
Arena de Verona, where Jordan’s concert is going to begin shortly, is seen in 
the background.

popular Jordan song is heard playing on someone’s I pod. Security personnel and 
volunteers in flourescent costume are seen crossing.  
Some spectators wave at the camera as it passes them.  
[E] 
The console room. Engineers doing checks, sipping coffee.  
A fader is pushed up. Boom boom sound of a drum bass fades in.  
[F] 
Empty stadium. With the console room in the centre, stage on one side. The 
boom boom boom of the drum bass resound. 
[G]  
The stage in the stadium. Many technicians on stage. Sound check has begun.  
The drum-kick being played.  
The drummer, to check mike, turns and picks up his sticks and begins to play 
on the drums.

Verona Scape, Lanes 
Another part of the city.  
Down a lane, a street fight in progress. A few men, wearing the uniform of a 
brass band, grapple with a man, try to snatch his money from him. They speak to each 
other in rustic Italian. 
Brass 1 
You grab the wallet, take it…  
Brass 2 
Hold his hands, hold his hands. 
 
They try holding his hands. The man, almost down to the cobbles of the lane, 
tries to slither out of their grasp.  
This is Jordan.  
Brass 1 
Got it?  
Brass 2 
Not yet. Hold. 
Jordan swings his arms violently, tries to stand, slips.  
Brass 3 
(loud) Don’t let him go. Pin the bastard down. 
 
Jordan hits, is hit as the scruffy fist fight goes on for a while. They grab him 
again. Suddenly, Jordan screams and steps up desperate energy. He hits, pushes and 
gets out of the grasp of his slightly surprised opponents. And runs down the lane. The 
band members are stupefied for a moment, then – 
Brass 3 
Mother fucker…  
Brass 1 
Catch him… 
They  run after him.

Jordan runs down the lanes, turns some corners.

Bus on City Street 
 
Jordan enters a bus. His breath is up.  
Some people turn to look. He is dishevelled. He wipes some grime, some 
blood off his face as he walks to the front seat.  
He sits, tries to even his breath. Some Asians sitting behind him look at him in 
recognition.  
The bus is moving forward. From the wind-shield, a building wrap is seen 
approaching. It is a huge banner that reads – ‘Jordan Live’, The ‘Wings on Fire’ tour.   
A fat old lady, sitting behind Jordan looks at it.  
There is the picture of Jordan in performance on the banner.  
The lady looks towards Jordan in intrigue.  
Jordan is checking his jaw, which seems to be cut. He notices the hoarding. 
It is a huge picture of his face in performance.  
He looks away, checks his bruised knuckles.

Arena Bus Stop 
Bus approaches the arena stop. It is quite vacant by now. The crowd has gone 
inside, live music is heard being played inside the arena.  
Jordan gets off, walks to the security barricade. Three Italian girls sight him 
and scream. They run after him.  
The security stops Jordan at the barricade. Jordan pushes at them.  
A couple of volunteers run and tell them off.  
Jordan kicks off the barricade in some restlessness and clambers over it.

Approaching Montage 
One of the volunteers snatches the walkie from another as he paces up with 
Jordan towards the stadium. He begins to speak into the walkie even as the other 
volunteer tries to disentangle from the walkie wires. 
Volunteer   
(In Italian) Jordan walking in, Jordan walking to the stadium. Send 
security to the East Gate… 
The Italian girls are stopped at the barricade. Giordano, Giordano, they 
scream. 
Jordan walks towards the gate, security men run in and align with him. Some 
people standing around try to click pictures, call his name.  
Volunteer

Jordan walks through the entrance gate that we have seen earlier.

Volunteer 
(In Italian) Jordan crossing Gate 17.  
Inside the arena, Jordan walks through the tunnel with a formation of security. 
Haaa, haaa, he screams to open his throat for performance. He stretches his fingers 
and moves his wrist as he prepares.  
Volunteer 
(In Italian) Jordan walking the tunnel… Jordan approaching the 
backstage…  
People moving in are held back by security as Jordan’s entourage crosses 
them. Suddenly, Jordan stops and turns to steps leading up on his right.  
Volunteer 
(In Italian) Change of plan… Jordan entering through audience gate… 
N66…  
 
The volunteers and a security guard rush after him.  
Volunteer 
(In Italian) Change of plan… Jordan entering audience gate N66… 
Send security to N 66… 
Jordan parts the curtain of the gate and runs up.  
The crowd parts and a path is made as the entourage passes through. New 
security guards have joined. Jordan strides towards the stage, checking his shirt which 
is torn from the elbow.  
The stadium is full now. A faint, hollow cheer of the stadium crowd is heard – 
Jordan, Jordan, Jordan, Jordan.  
Some senior organizers rush up to Jordan in massive relief as he comes to the 
stage. Jordan cuts past them, climbs up the stage.  
Volunteer 
Jordan on stage. Jordan on stage. 
The drummer and bass guitarist heave a sigh of relief as they see Jordan. 
Jordan walks to the depth of the stage. The other musicians taking final positions.  
A girl guitar technician rushes to Jordan with his guitar. Sound engineers are 
hooking mikes to him.  
Jordan, Jordan, Jordan, Jordan, the crowd is growing louder. Music is building 
up on the stage. 
Jordan stands backing the audience, getting ready. He is making sounds, 
screaming, clearing his voice. The crowd begins to scream more.

A mike rises from the floor of the stage. The music is building up.  
Jordan turns to the crowd.  
Manic screaming.  
Jordan walks to the front, music builds up.  
The mike, Jordan coming to it. 
He reaches the mike, is about to start singing.

Song # 1 
Janardan, seven years back, starts to sing the song. He has a guitar in his hand. 
He is nervous. He is standing under a tree in the college campus. Some other students 
and a judge are around. This is an audition for a Platinum Music talent drive.  
Titles begin.  
A dozen other situations. Janardan / Jordan is singing. Various points of time 
in his life. Dramatically different settings. Singing sometimes in performance,

sometimes alone. He appears different in the various situations. His attitude varies. He 
is seen in a serious concert performance in a European opera house,  playing in a 
guitar shop in Delhi, playing in a Delhi ‘Jaagran’, at a studio recording, in a college 
canteen, at a town square in a western country, then to prostitutes in a Bombay 
brothel. This montage is an indication of the journey of seven years in his life.  
This is a song of the travelling soul. With sparse acoustic arrangement. I see a 
lot of things around me, the words say. I have felt a lot of strange things. I have a lot 
to say, but words keeps spoiling it. Words destroy what I have to say.  
One of the situations is at the Lado Sarai bus stop. It is afternoon. Janardan is 
singing the song on the guitar, coming close to the bus stop. Regular people at the bus 
stop, waiting for the bus, are turning to him, looking at him in intrigue. After a while, 
two constables are seen walking up from behind him.

The second constable grabs the guitar. Pull and push of the guitar, whinings 
from Janardan –  
Janardan 
Sir sir, ek minute… dekho ye…  
Constable 2 
Chhod, chhod… 
Janardan 
…ek minute, ek minute, taar taar…  
Another slap.  
The squabble is seen from a distance, as cars pass, commuters watch.

Meanwhile Janardan continues –

Empty stage. A mike in the center. Front light on it. Janardan walks in with his 
guitar.  
He is nervous, awkward.  
Lead Guitarist (OC) Yaar, ye to mara hua piece hai… 
Janardan strains to look into the darkness of the audience.  
The audience seats are empty. Except for around ten people who are sprawled  
out in the middle seats. This is a university band called The Jovian Saints and their 
friends.  
Girl 1  
Aur ye Jamna paar ka fashion hai…?  
Janardan hears titters.  
Keyboardist 
(OC) To Be With You… Lead break.  
Janardan thinks for a moment, begins to play.  
Chadda 
(suddenly) Oye thoda style rakh yaar… 
Janardan stops. Chadda is the drummer of Jovian Saints. He is the drummer 
we saw in Jordan’s band in the beginning of the story. He stands.  
Chadda 
Tu stage par hai. Stage presence honi chahiye ki nahin…? Attitude… 
Aise… Aise…  
Chadda is walking like that, demostrating.  
Chadda 
Jaise ki phaadh dene waala hai sabki… Come on…  
Janardan stiffens his attitude a bit, tries to look stylish. Gets into position, 
plays, loses attitude.  
Stops. Gets into a different position, gets into attitude, plays.  
Stops, sits on the stool. Plays. Stops.  
Gets into another position, tries attitude, plays. Stops.

Khatana 
Tu sab ki zindagi utha ke dekh le – jittey bhi hain na ye

It’s the green room. He sees a figure inside. It is a girl wearing leotards, doing 
some dance stretches and preparation before the performance.

Actually… too na… badi cool lagti hai mujhe. Ye kehna tha… Aur hot

Haan. I love you.

Heer driving a motorbike on the street. Janardan is sitting behind her. She is 
very excited.  
 
A sign on the wall saying – ‘Dekho kutta peshaab kar raha hai’. A row of men 
peeing on the wall. Heer walks behind close to the men. They panic. She runs away to 
Janardan’s bike. He takes off as they laugh. 
 
Janaradan drops Heer at the back gate of Stephens College. She gets off 
furtively and skips to the gate. Then walks casually and enters the gate.  
 
Another day, Heer says bye to her friends at the gate, walks to her left as they 
walk to the right. She walks, looks back. Janardan comes on his motorbike, she looks 
towards her friends, crosses the street.  
 
Janardan is sitting next to his bike near the closed gate of Hindu College. He 
sees her and gets up, starts the bike. She come up to him.

Song # 2 
Fade-in. Traditional Kashmiri music is being played live at the wedding. 
People watch. Typical activities ensue. The traditional Kashmiri wedding feast in 
progress. The wedding villa in Srinagar in its bustle seen from bird’s eye view. Fade-
out. 
Fade-in. Hills and valleys of Kashmir at sunset.  
Jordan at the window seat of a bus. He is looking out of the window at the 
fading landscape outside. He is lost in thought.  
The song begins with a strong guitar riff. It gives a feeling of a strong 
significance that we are not aware of now, but will perhaps appreciate later. With the 
heavy riff mixes the Kashmiri cyclical pattern of song.  
Jordan, two years later, singing the song. He is recording the song in a studio.  
A music CD on a retail rack. It is an album called ‘Sheher’. Songs are by Dilip 
Menon and Jordan. 
The groove kicks in as Jordan performs the song at a small platform in a 
nightclub in Delhi. People dancing. We have seen a glimpse of this situation in the 
title sequence. This is a western rock song. It has a strong groove and some trance 
appeal.  
Another day, Jordan is sitting at the old ruins at sunset. This is where Heer and 
he had country liquor. He is having an orange ice candy now, looking around.  
Jordan walks on a street divider during sun-set.  
After sun set, he is looking at his Peetampura house from the shadows of the 
lane. 
Later, he is at the bar of a nightclub. He drains some alchohol from his glass 
on to his hand, applies it to his neck and shirt, drains the rest into a large beaker.

He gets up and walks to the dance area, beginning to move and dance and 
pretending to be drunk. He enters the dance floor, dancing aggressively. He is dancing 
with some new made friends.  
After a while, we see that a girl on the dance floor is looking at him, trying to 
assess if it is him. She has been dancing with her friends, now she is moving to get a 
better look at Jordan’s face. He continues to dance in his manner. The girl finally 
realizes that it is him, looks pissed off with him as she continues to move to the 
music.

Arey main bol raha hoon maine paise nahin liye… Aap log bas peetna

Father in the courtyard, stops eating, turns and looks.  
Mother stops weeping.  
Young bhabi freezes, suddenly removes her hands from him.  
Jordan continues, unmindful of what he has started –  
Jordan

A ferocious slap cuts Jordan’s face. Jordan is shocked.

Song # 3 
The dargah of Hazrat Nizamuddin at night. Qawwali is beginning. Claps and 
the harmonium are heard.  
The eldest brother is pulling Jordan by his scruff and throwing him out of the 
house. Jordan is holding a bag.  
He is pushed down the steps. Jordan turns to look back, surprised, heart 
beating fast.  
Middle brother is fuming at the verandah. Everyone in the family is near the 
entrance, in a freeze.  
Jordan’s neice carries his guitar to him.  
Jordan takes the guitar, still looking in surprise at the house. Then he turns like 
a grumpy kid and walks out.  
Jordan comes to the lamp-post in front of his house, turns and looks – 
expecting someone to come and stop him.  
The house, no one is calling him.  
He turns back, question on his face. He walks out.  
 
Jordan walking down the lanes alone. 
 
Another part of the city, Jordan walks up, still puzzled. 
  
Jordan is sitting on the pavement next to a busy street, looking at the passing 
cars, at the city.  
The dargah lane, brightly lit. Jordan walks with his bag and guitar. He enters 
the dargah.  
Jordan is lying down. The qawwals sing. Gradually, Jordan gets drawn to the 
music. He sits up, begins to get involved. 
 
Another day, he is closer to the qawwals, more involved. He begins to clap, 
then begins to sing with the chorus. 
!99

 
The poetry of the qawwali is about the struggle of the human soul to unite 
with the supreme. 
 
Jordan sitting on a pavement somewhere in busy Delhi, looking up at the 
world. He is getting affected by the spirituality of the music.  
 
Jordan is walking in the crowd. 
 
The qawwali in progress another day. The guitar comes out of the case. Jordan 
begins to accompany on the guitar. The qawwals are interested to see where this goes, 
and gradually very pleased. Jordan warms up into the qawwali.  
 
Another day, he is singing qawwali and playing the guitar. Ustad Jameel Khan 
passes from there. He sees Jordan. Jordan does not notice him, as he is involved with 
the song. Ustad looks at him for a while.  
 
Electric guitar takes over the song as a doorbell is pressed. Jordan is standing 
outside Khatana’s door, as seen before in Sc # 52. Khatana opens the door.   
 
Later in the night, Jordan eats hungrily at Khatana’s table as his wife serves 
him. Khatana watches.   
 
The song fades into into a Jaagran. At the onset of Navrata, Khatana is seen 
organizing a modest Mata ki Chowki. Jordan is at the stage with his guitar, singing 
Jaagran.  
 
Jordan performing at a large Jaagran. Khatana is sitting in the crowd. He looks 
around. The audience is very pleased.  
 
The Jaagran download playing on U Tube. Dilip Menon, a music director who 
we have seen judging the university talent drive for Platinum Music in the title song, 
is looking at the computer screen. There are two others with him.

Ustad is looking at Jordan with different eyes, seeing in him something that 
others in the room can not. Jordan looks at the Ustad too, he looks familiar.

Jordan walks up the path with a uniformed servant. The servant indicates 
towards Dhingra. Jordan is looking.  
Dhingra is wearing shorts. His wig is tied to position by a band. It is a 
desperate massage with hints of violence. Presently, the pehelwaan knots both his 
arms behind his back.  
Dhingra 
(to Jordan) Aa ja, aa ja…  
 
The pehelwan wrenches.  
Dhingra 
(yelps) Aaahhh… 
Jordan sits on a chair next to Dhingra’s khaat, finding this very funny.  
Dhingra 
Happy Birthday… Aaj samajh le naya janam hai tera. Aaj se tu 
Platinum music ka artist hai. Sheher album mein tere gaane pasand 
aaye mujhe… To maine socha…  
The pehelwaan pulls both his legs behind his waist.

Dhingra 
Aahh… Teri… Araam naal… 
Jordan finds it very tough to keep a straight face. He looks slightly away, 
determined.  
Dhingra 
To ab tu apni album karega… full solo… Congratulation. (reacting to 
massage) Aahhh, arey…? 
Jordan has to put up more effort to keep his face straight.  
 
Dhingra is being tossed and turned by the pehelwaan, as he contiunes to talk – 
Dhingra 
Ab tujhe seekhna hai ki star kaise bante hain. Kyonki music-voosik to 
theek hai, bahot log bajaate hain music… (yelps) Aahh… Dekh ke… 
(to Jordan) Asal baat hoti hai image… Samjha? 
Jordan sees that Dhingra’s neck is wrung by the pehelwaan’s arm now. 
Dhingra

O teri to… Maar doonga bata raha hoon… 
Jordan is pinching himself to not laugh.

The pehelwan twists Dhingra’s torso away.  
Dhingra 
(reacting to the massage) Oye… Aah… (to Jordan) Par tu ghabra mat, 
main bataoonga tujhe kya karna hai. Bus tu itna yaad rakh ki aaj se tu 
sangeetkar nahin hai… Tu kya hai…? 
The pehelwan twists him around so he can look towards Jordan.  
Dhingra 
(reacting to twist) Teri… (to Jordan) Kya hai tu…? Bol…? Aahh… 
Bata bata…? 
Jordan suddenly bursts out laughing on Dhingra’s face.  
Dhingra is stunned.  
Jordan immediately stops himself.  
Jordan  
Sorry sir…

Dhingra looks at Jordan in disbelief. Pause.  
Jordan bursts out in bigger, uncontrollable laughter.  
Dhingra’s blood begins to boil. The pehelwaan wrenches.  
Dhingra 
Ahh… Chhod teri… 
Jordan gets up and rushes out, doubling with laughter.  
Dhingra gnashes his teeth.

Song # 4 
 
Jordan walks up a typical Prague lane, following the sound of an accordian 
playing. He turns into a lane. He can hear fiddles playing as well. He comes up to a 
street corner. It is a group of gypsie musicians playing a folk song. The accordian 
player looks at him. Jordan is getting involved with the music. He does not wish 
them, is moving to a different rhythm. Jordan starts to play the chords that he is 
thinking on his imaginery guitar. The guitar builds up.  
!132

 
Jordan is playing a real guitar with the gypsie musicians. The musicians are 
invigorated playing with Jordan.   
 
Later in the day, on the corner of a bridge on the river, Jordan is playing the 
guitar with the same musicians. Some other musicans have joined them. Jordan has 
begun to sing the Czech folk tale of the queen who wore out twelve pairs of shoes 
everyday. People have got attracted to this and begin to crowd around. Jordan is 
sitting on the pavement. Dhingra is standing at a distance with some European 
organizers, surprised and happy that Jordan is finding favour.    
 
On other days, the group is seen playing at a town square and then in a public 
garden.  
 
Another day, the musicans and many more are assembled in a courtyard, 
playing with Jordan. This is the designated rehearsal space for Eurojam. The track has 
gained momentum. Jordan vibes with all musicians, completely entranced. A fat lady 
singer begins to sing some Czech verses. Jordan sings in Hindi. Dhingra is there with 
many others. He is moving to the music, very happy. After a while, Heer walks in. 
Jordan looks at her but does not respond. She smiles, comes forward and sits on the 
steps, listens.  
  
At the strip bar, the girls are dancing. Heer and Jordan are sitting in the front 
row, thrilled.  
 
 
Red light district, girls standing on the pavement. Heer and Jordan proposition 
a few of them. Both are thrilled. Then Heer runs up and stands ahead on the pavement 
like a tart. Jordan acts as the client, comes up to her. She turns and looks at him coyly. 
He touches her clothes to look at her booty, then makes a face, shakes his head and 
moves ahead. She chases after him, he runs.  
 
 
She tries to turn him around and uncover his eyes as they sit in a male strip 
bar.  
 
Next day at the rehearsal there is a melee of European folk dancers, dancing to 
the music. A local musician is dancing to the song as well. Heer is standing to the 
side, moving to the music. He asks Heer for a dance, takes her hand and continues to 
dance. She gushes, begins to dance. The musician leads her to the folk dancers. He 
leaves her hand, she continues to dance with the folk dancers. She gets thrilled in the 
dance, she opens up.  
 
 
Heer dances with folk dancers.   
!133

 
Another day. The place is a carnival now. Numbers of folk dancers and other 
artists have joined in. Heer dances with the gypsie folk dancers. She is thrilled. She is 
dancing again. In full gusto. 
 
Another day, Heer dancing like mad with Jordan at a cheap pub. It’s too early 
for dancing, there’s no one else on the dance floor, but she is having a great time. And 
Jordan is dancing like Dharmendra. 
 
Another day, Jordan and Heer on the bike. He is driving fast. She holds him. 
After a while, she closes her eyes, holds him dearly.

Item hain hum dono… Agar koi sun le ki hum kya baatein kartein

at the distance.  
She is looking ahead. He gets off the bike, walks up to her. She can sense him 
coming. 
He comes next to her. They stand silently for a while. He touches her hand 
with his finger. Continues. Pause.  
She turns towards him.  
Heer

He holds her arm. He is looking at her, not smiling any more, getting in the 
grip of some power. Her smiles goes away, heartbeat rises.

They come to their knees. She pushes away from him. She pushes him again.  
He falls, she stands up.

Jordan is wearing a gaudy formal dinner jacket and trousers. Meena makes a 
face and gesture at Heer from behind Jordan to say ‘what the hell is he wearing?’, 
then says – 
Meena  
Main Jay ko bulaati hoon… 
Meena goes into the other room.  
Heer has a faint smile on her face. She comes up to him.  
Heer 
 
Ye pehna kya hai tumne? 
Jordan 
Dinner jacket…? Maine poochha tha, badi waali dukaan mein… Un ne 
kaha yehi dalte hain yahan dinner pe… Kyon? 
She shakes her head.  
Jordan 
Bata na yaar… Vaise bhi ameer logon ke ghar mein bahot nervous

It is Heer, coming to meet Jordan.  
She walks up the slope to the small park on the hill.

shoulder. Her breath is rising. She is still looking down. He takes her other hand, puts 
it on his shoulder too. Then pulls her to a hug.  
She closes her eyes, places her forehead on his shoulder.

Song # 5 
 
Heer and Jordan. In the grip of a pulsating feeling that pulls them together. A 
connection that they can not fight. Hands quiver when they hold each other. Bodies 
shake, breath is always uneven. Heer knows that this should not be happening. But it 
is. She is restless, tries to fight her desire, but it is compulsive. The feeling only 
grows, the passion only increases.   
 
This is the song Jordan is making now.  
Heer comes in as a volunteer.  
 
What should I do with you so that I feel relief?  
 
Jordan records this song at a studio in Prague.  
 
Jordan performs the song at an opera house. With local musicians. Shirin and 
Meena are in the audience.  
Dhingra is very pleased with the performance.  
!153

Jordan looks at Heer as he performs. She stands in the wings, looking towards 
him, breathing heavily.  
The performance ends. Silence. Jordan marches out of stage towards Heer.  
Heer’s heartbeat climbs on seeing him come.  
He kisses her. The audience begins massive applause.  
Volunteers run to that side to see what’s up. 
Heer pushes Jordan out.  
Jordan comes back on stage. Takes the bow.  
Heer closes her eyes, puts her forehead on the wing.  
Audience stands in applause.  
Dhingra claps the loudest.  
Heer turns around, tries to control herself.  
 
Jordan bows again with the musicians.

window near the coffee table is open, the curtain is blowing.  
She strains to hear, still half in sleep.  
She gets out of her bed, walks towards the window. 
She comes into the tower window, looks out.  
A security vehicle screeches to a halt in front of the villa, a few armed security 
men jump out. Dogs are barking.  
Heer gets worried. She turns back into the room.  
The siren is heard louder as she moves to the other side of the room. Suddenly, 
lights come on behind the tall windows. She turns and opens the windows, looks out.

the steps. Both can not believe what they just saw. The housekeeper and a gardener

But he is handled and pushed forwards.  
He feels a shaking hollowness in the pit of his stomach. He keeps his head 
down and walks to the vehicle. Then he feels as though something is tearing inside 
him. He pulls at the security men unnecessarily. They apprehend him strongly. He 
pushes the hand away, elbows the security man. The security man hits him. Jordan 
hits back. The securitymen pounce upon him.

Bahot saal pehle, yahan ek jungle hota tha. Ghana, bhayanak jungle… 
Phir ek din yahan sheher ban gaya… Saaf-suthre makaan, seedhe raste. 
Sab kuch tareeke se hone laga. Par jis din jungle kata, us din parindon

The security-man runs across the street to get the car. Khatana and Jordan 
cross the street. Silence.  
As they reach the other side of the street, Khatana suddenly stops and fires 
Jordan. 
Khatana 
Ye din bhi aa gaya. Aisi jagah se nikaalna pada tujhe. Shuroo hone ke 
pehle hi khatam ho jayega tu, meri baat yaad rakhna. Teri reputation 
buri se aur buri hoti ja rahi hai aur tujhe pata bhi nahin chalega kab log 
tujhse nafrat karne lagenge. (pause) Kya ho gaya hai tujhe JJ…? Kya 
banta ja raha hai tu…? Dekh khud ko… dekh… Tu kya chahta hai ki 
log tujhse door bhaagein…?

Khatana and Jordan turn back to look.  
A girl has seen Jordan from across the street. She is hopping, screaming.  
Girl 1  
Jordan… Hi…  
A few others join her. 
Boy 1  
O yeah… Hey… 
 
Another scream is heard from behind Jordan and Khatana.

Jordan and Khatana turn in that direction. 
Two other girls are running up to him from their side of the street, waving. 
Girl 2  
Jordan wait… 
Girl 3  
Wait… please… 
People around Jordan begin to notice him now. Jordan taps Khatana on his 
shoulder to walk away. Khatana looks in the direction of the first girl. A huge number 
of college students have gathered. They’re screaming, trying to cross the street.

Jordan walks Khatana up the sidewalk. The security man keeps the fans at a 
distance behind them. 
Khatana 
(distracted, scolds) Tu sun raha hai meri baat?

Khatana 
Bahot zaroori baat kar raha hoon main…

Hi Jordan…

Hiiiiii, aapke saath ek photo le sakte hain?

Nahin le sakte… Hato saamne se… 
Jordan walks Khatana ahead.

The bunch of youngsters is trailing them.  
Girl 4  
Please please please… hum wait karenge…

They walk after him. A constable comes in to keep them at bay.  
The first bunch crosses the street, runs in, screaming his name, calling their 
friends.  
Khatana 
Jo bhi tujhse milta hai, vo output ho jaata hai tujhse…  
Flashes.  
Fans are standing along the railings in Jordan’s path, waiting for him, clicking 
pictures with their phone cameras, calling out, extending notebooks for autographs. 
Khatana is looking around, baffled by Jordan’s growing popularity. But he is 
committed to scolding Jordan.  
Khatana 
(distracted) Girti ja rahi hai popularity teri, pata bhi hai tujhe…?  
Another security man meets them there.  
Security 2 
Sir yaheen ruko, gaadi aa rahi hai.

Khatana and Jordan stop. The second security-man begins to keep the fans at

Massive screaming.

He turns to look.  
Jordan has torn the contract to four pieces. Now he assembles it to tear to 
further pieces.  
 
The sound of paper tearing. Khatana holds his head. Dhingra stands up, looks 
at his subordinate. Subordinate gives a reaction of disbelief. The lawyer is looking.  
More sound of tearing. Dhingra is unable to react for the moment. 
Jordan smiles to himself, while making smaller bits.  
Then he stands and walks up to Dhingra, becoming serious again. He 
continues to tear the contract to smaller bits, then shakes the bits.

bits of paper on Dhingra’s head. Khatana jumps up, tries to stop Jordan.

Heer 
Ab kabhi nahin hone doongi ye… Ye meri zindagi ki sabse badi ghalati 
hai. Pata nahin kaise main…? Mujhe us waqt bhi maloom tha main 
ghalat kar rahi hoon… har second pata tha… poori koshish kar rahi thi 
ki kisi tarah rok loon khud ko magar… Pata nahin kyon, pata nahin

Jordan in a posture of just having finished the performance at the open stage in

He remains in that posture, gets out of the performance.  
He turns, walks back on the ramp. Something catches his eye.  
We see some young boys and girls screaming out to him as he comes close to 
them.  
He looks.  
One of them, shouting the loudest, is Mandy, Heer’s sister. Sound returns

Afternoon. Curtains are flying in the breeze, shadows are playing on the walls. 
There is someone on his knees next to her. It is Jordan.

Uth na bahut bore ho raha hoon. Kitta soyegi?

on a chair. Like he used to stand in front of his house.  
Jordan waiting.  
Rock music thickens in the soundtrack. 
Breaking all records, is a poster of Jordan’s latest album.  
Glimpses of Jordan’s crazy life-style.  
He is puking at parties.  
Khatana negotiating with some lawyers and corporates in a board room.  
Jordan is being clicked by a hundred cameras.  
Silence. 
Jordan sitting in the waiting area of Heer’s hospital at night.  
Ustad Jameel Khan, sitting in his room, looking to his right, tries to get up.  
Ustad’s nephews take him to the window, open it.

There is a huge hoarding of Jordan endorsing a brand.  
Ustad looks at the hoarding with a bitter-sweet smile. 
Music builds up. 
Jordan’s new album on the stands of music shops.  
Many pictures of Jordan in newspapers with various headings – fights, legal 
battles, great sales, nasty comments from him.  
Jordan’s niece looking.  
Jordan’s poster on his old room wall, in the middle of the old posters of Jim 
Morisson, Pink Floyd, Led Zepplin etc. 
Girls screaming his name as Jordan’s car passes.  
Dhingra holds him happily and gets clicked. 
Unruly crowd at a publicity venue as Jordan walks out.  
Silence. 
Jordan sitting in the waiting area of Heer’s hospital at night.  
Lyrics of the song begin. 
Jordan throws his cards down and picks up the money lying on the table. It is a 
game of gambling at the pub in Verona. He gets up and kicks the table, the brass band 
members at the table are taken aback. One of them grabs him, he pushes him away, 
walks out as the band members chase after him.  
The arena we saw at the beginning of the story.  
The gates open and crowd rushes in to be close to the stage.  
Jordan’s pictures on banners. Video screens and huge speakers.  
Night. The music that is coming from the stage is setting the audience on fire.

Jordan on stage, where we had seen him in the beginning.  
The song is a heart-rending cry of the soul – in hard rock style. A hard, loud 
spectactle that breaks your heart.  
I am trapped in a bad dream, the lyrics are saying. I want to wake up. Because 
when I wake up, I know I will be with you.  
Riots and stampedes and faintings as he sings his heart out to the bright 
scanner lights.  
This is Jordan, the icon of modern music, performing live. 
 
Midways in the performance, in the middle of a line, Jordan stops singing. He 
falls silent, stares in front.  
The music plays for some time, then comes to a stop.  
Jordan is staring into space, lost to the world, in a trance.  
The bright lights wash him.  
Jordan is looking at Heer.  
Heer is stepping up from the middle of stage. She looks at him. She is looking 
bright, untouched by any illness.  
Heer smiles at Jordan, begins to walk to him.  
Jordan is looking at her. The audience begins to cheer aloud. Jordan, Jordan, 
Jordan – the stadium is heard bellowing.  
Heer reaches him, smiling. She has come to him. She becomes translucent for 
a moment, then opaque again.  
Jordan stands there, staring into space. Jordan, Jordan, Jordan, the stadium 
echoes. But all the sound fades out. He is looking at Heer.  
It is only her and him. She is smiling at him.  
He is seeing her.  
Heer’s Voice-over is heard – “Shh…”

Black.  
Heer’s voice resounds – “Shh…”

Flashback. Heer pulls a white sheet over Jordan and herself. They lie together.

Heer 
Sab chale gaye… Ye hamaari duniya hai… Sirf hamaari… yahan aur 
koi nahin hai… Koi journalist nahin, koi photographer nahin… Na 
society, na rules…  
Jordan  
Aur Bone Marrow Aplasia nahin…  
Heer 
 
Hospital nahin, doctor nahin…  
Jordan  
Koi contract nahin… 
Heer 
 
Na koi court-case… 
Jordan  
Na shaadi…  
 
Heer pulls closer to him.  
Heer 
Koi rok nahin… Koi daayra nahin… Is duniya mein... chhod sakte hai 
sab kuch… (bright) Tumhein hamaari duniya pasand aayi Jordan? 
Jordan 
Baahar reh nahin paoonga main… 
Heer 
Rehna bhi nahin hai baahar. Yaheen rehna hai. Abhi… Hamesha…

Song # 8 
Fade-in. Jordan and Heer driving up on the bike from a distance. They are 
frolicking. Heer is pretending to fly with her arms.  
 
The song begins in the background.  
This is the song that Jordan had sung to Heer. A light, happy, personal song. 
The only song he had sung for her. And only for her.  
We see him singing this for her at different times. In Prague, and Delhi – 
during their times together.  
This is interspersed with visuals of Heer and Jordan at the happiest times in 
their lives. In their journey together.  
 
 Now you never have to leave, the song says. I do not have to look for you 
anymore. We are together now. We are together forever.
