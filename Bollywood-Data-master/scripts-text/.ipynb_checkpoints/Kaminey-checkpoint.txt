On black, we hear the sound of gospel singing in chorus.

FADE IN:
EXT. AFRICAN HAMLET-TWILIGHT
A sleepy African hamlet in the twilight. The sound of the 
gospel spreads over the countryside. A group of small kids 
play football with a plastic bottle in the village square.
SUPER appears- CUANGO VALLEY,ANGOLA
INT. AFRICAN HAMLET- LOCAL CHURCH
As the camera tracks down from the bleeding visage of Christ, 
a group of local village elders stand in a row and sing the 
gospel. 
EXT. AFRICAN HAMLET-LOCAL CHURCH
A battered cross on the church roof. As the camera cranes 
up,a convoy of inconspicuous jeeps can be seen on a distant 
hilly road,making their way towards the village.
INT. AFRICAN HAMLET-VILLAGE HOUSE-KITCHEN / LIVING ROOM
A heavily pregnant girl, LIBERTA, takes out hot soup into 
bowls from a vessel on the top of the gas stove.
An intense discussion can be heard coming out of the living 
room. The camera travels with her as she walks into the room 
to set the dinner table.
An old couple and two three male elders, sit around the 
table. There is tension in the air. Leading the discussion is 
WELKETT, the husband of the pregnant lady. They notice her 
presence and the argument stops. DANIEL mimics the size of 
her belly.
DANIEL
She can’t get out of the door of 
the house with the size of her 
belly and you are asking us to 
leave the village.
LIBERTA puts the soup bowls on the table. Her eyes meet her 
husband’s. They share a tense look. She leaves the room.
EXT. AFRICAN HAMLET - WOODS
A jeep noiselessly comes to a stop as the engine is shut. 
CAJETAN, a rugged young man of 32, sits inside with 3 of his 
friends.

Cajetan puts on the stereo and shuffles around for the knob. 
Just when the music blares out,the senior occupant slaps his 
hands and chides him in whispers. Cajetan glares back at him. 
They all sit quietly in the stillness for a while. Cajetan 
starts humming the song softly under his breath. The sun dies 
over the horizon.
INT. AFRICAN HAMLET-VILLAGE HOUSE-KITCHEN
VERA calls out to someone while setting the other dishes 
inside the kitchen.
VERA
GERSELINO, come and fetch your 
dinner
INT. AFRICAN HAMLET - VILLAGE HOUSE-BEDROOM
A boy,about 12 years old is looking for something in the 
cupboard. He calls out loudly.
GERSELINO
      Coming, mom.
Suddenly he hears a whistle and looks out of the window. His 
friends are downstairs waiting for him.
EXT. AFRICAN HAMLET- CONTINUOUS
Wide shot of the village as the sound of the gospel grows 
faint. Small lights like diamonds glow here and there as 
lights come on in some houses.
EXT. AFRICAN HAMLET-WOODS
The Senior man takes in this magical sight. He now glances at 
his watch and gestures in sign language to the others. The 
men uncover the tarmac cloth  at the back of the jeep. Its 
full of sophisticated weapons and ammunition ! 
INT. AFRICAN HAMLET - CHURCH
The church organ is caressed by wiry fingers as the gospel 
music soars over the gathering.
INT. AFRICAN HAMLET - VILLAGE HOUSE
The dinner is underway. VERA enquires after the pregnant 
woman.
                    2.

VERA
What did the doc have to say about 
your football?
In the meantime, GERSELINO emerges out of the bedroom and 
runs towards the main door. He hides something in his 
clenched fist. His mother notices him.
VERA
Where do you think you are going?
The boy turns and mock kicks the air.
GERSELINO
         Football..
VERA
Nothing doing..have your dinner 
first.
Before she can move, GERSELINO makes a face and runs out. His 
mother shrugs her shoulders and settles back for dinner.
LIBERTA
      (Turns to VERA)
         He says there may be twins this time..
VERA makes a silent gesture of prayer as DANIEL smiles and 
shows his son two fingers. The son looks concerned.
EXT. AFRICAN HAMLET-WOODS
Two dozen heavily armed soldiers of the rebel militia  now 
troop out noiselessly, last among them is Cajetan. The 
soldiers take position just before the clearing and train 
their guns towards the hamlet. 
INT. AFRICAN HAMLET- LOCAL CHURCH
The gospel sound rises in harmony.
EXT. AFRICAN HAMLET-VILLAGE HOUSE-BACKYARD 
A playful fight ensues between the kids playing football. 
They laugh around and try to pry open GERSELINO’s fist. As 
the scuffle gets serious-
INT. AFRICAN HAMLET - VILLAGE HOUSE
The husband bangs his plate loudly. Everyone stops eating.
WELKETT
Enough is enough.. I am leaving 
tonight.
He turns to his wife. His eyes run with emotion.
                    3.

WELKETT
Are you coming along ?
DANIEL pleads with his son.
DANIEL
Have some mercy.. son!
WELKETT
Let’s see who shows mercy when 
those bastards come looking for us.
He gently pats his wife’s stomach.
WELKETT
        All of us..
He mock shoots a gun using his fingers.
WELKETT
        Boom Boom !
EXT. AFRICAN HAMLET-LOCAL CHURCH 
The rebels have now reached the outside of the church.
INT. AFRICAN HAMLET- LOCAL CHURCH
The gospel inside reaches a crescendo.
EXT. AFRICAN HAMLET-VILLAGE HOUSE-BACKYARD 
A tiny fist opens and two identical twin diamonds glisten in 
the dark. The other boys look on dazzled as the diamonds 
glisten in the dark. 
Suddenly, heavy sounds of gunfire are heard.
INT. AFRICAN HAMLET- LOCAL CHURCH
The rebels mercilessly shoot the villagers inside the church. 
The church walls are splashed in red. The organ is shots to 
bits.
EXT. AFRICAN HAMLET - VILLAGE SQUARE
As we cut outside, we see the rebels storming the village, 
cutting down whoever gets in the way. As people run out in 
the village square, they get caught in the gunfire. Innocent 
villagers crumple by the dozen. Cajetan is at the forefront 
and seems to enjoy the destruction brought upon by his gun. 
                    4.

EXT. AFRICAN HAMLET - VILLAGE SQUARE/HOUSE
Now the natives also go for their guns. As the action spreads 
from the main village square, a bloodbath begins. The 
crossfire intensifies as young village boys,no more than 
15,fire back at the rebels. They are led by the family 
elders, including the husband and DANIEL,who give stiff 
resistance to the rebels.
Even as his comrades fall around him,Cajetan keeps shooting 
until the magazine runs out. He throws the gun away and 
quickly darts behind a wall as bullets thud in the cement, 
dangerously close to his face.
He crouches in the mud and now approaches the village house 
stealthily. He takes out his machete and ambushes the family 
members from behind. Crying at the top of his voice, he hacks 
WELKETT and DANIEL. Limbs fly left and right as Cajetan goes 
on a rampage. He almost breaks through the last line of 
defence when a man, pretending to be dead, shoots back at 
him. Cajetan curses and falls back and the ‘man’, who is 
actually GERSELINO, rushes inside to make a getaway. 
INT. AFRICAN HAMLET - VILLAGE HOUSE
As the rebels follow him into the house, they are surprised 
by a sudden burst of gunfire. As the first lot is cut down,we 
realize that VERA and the pregnant woman are firing away from 
automatic guns. After a brief gun battle, the woman and her 
daughter in law are both silenced by the rebels’ guns.
As the smoke settles,the injured Cajetan takes out his pistol 
and crawls towards the kids corner of the house. The boy is 
on his way out through the window. Cajetan fires several 
times and GERSELINO crumples near the window. 
Cajetan drags himself forward. The boy has something clutched 
in his hand. Cajetan’s eyes glimmer as he sees the two uncut 
diamonds in the dying youngster’s grasp.
His curiosity piqued, Cajetan groans and pushes himself 
closer to the kid. The diamonds shine in the dark. Just then 
someone calls out for him. He looks out of the window as his 
fellow soldiers shout for him.
EXT. AFRICAN HAMLET - VILLAGE HOUSE
Reinforcements head towards the house.
INT. AFRICAN HAMLET - VILLAGE HOUSE
Cajetan looks back at the diamonds, sweating and breathing 
heavily. He moves closer to the stones, leaving a trickle of 
blood on the floor.
As the voices of the soldiers come closer, Cajetan is torn 
between replying to their sermons and picking the stones from 
the dead boy’s hand. The moment is prolonged - 
                    5.

As the camera soars above the village, the remains of the 
burnt bodies and house fires dot the evening landscape.               
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Main f ko f bolta hoon, aur mere 
baap ne marte hue kaha tha ki beta 
Charlie, yaad rakhna... life badi 
kutti cheez hai. Aur iss duniya 
mein kutton ka bas ek hi javaab 
hai...
The title of the film appears.   
KAMINEY
FADE OUT.
EXT. TRAIN YARD - DAY
SUPER: COTTON GREEN, MUMBAI
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Zindagi mein hamaari vaat iffe nahi 
lagti ki hum kaunsa raasta chunte 
hain..
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Vaat lagti hai iffe ki hum kaun sa 
raasta chodte hain..
The road forks into two as we open in a defunct rail yard. It 
drizzles slightly. We cut to a close shot of a pair of eyes. 
This is CHARLIE, a young athletic boy in his twenties. As the 
rain pours down on him, he chooses the left lane and makes a 
dash. 
Cut to a group of young ruffian types who are running at the 
top of their lungs. Some of them brandish knives and chains. 
They scream at someone to stop. 
Cut back to Charlie. He runs between a parallel pair of 
tracks when two trains pass by in opposite directions. Visual 
freeze:
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Paifa kamaane ke do raaste hain, ek 
fhortcut aur doosra chota fhortcut.
EXT. TRAIN YARD - DAY
The dream ends as Charlie comes running from behind and 
overtakes the goons. He takes a short cut through the bogies 
and climbs on to the roof. 
                    6.

What follows is an amazing display of fleet footedness as 
Charlie sprints like a gazelle, jumping from one wagon roof 
to another. He finally starts to close in on his prey.
Cut to the prey. BURGESS, late twenties, runs for his life as 
Charlie and the goons breathe down his neck. Rivers of sweat 
run down his face as he keeps turning back in fear. Visual 
freeze as he cuts a sharp corner:
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Maine fortcut liya tha, par phir 
bhi mere sapno ki vaat lag gayi 
fir, vaat...
CUT TO:
EXT. RACE COURSE ARENA - CONTINUOUS
The genteel and fashionable glide through the race course 
club in their best. A well dressed Charlie is among them. 
EXT. RACE COURSE - VIEWERS GALLERY - CONTINUOUS
He takes off his binoculars and whispers into a pretty girl’s 
ears as they stand near the viewers’ gallery. 
CHARLIE
(whispers)
Blue Thunder.. 
Her laughter rings out like a chime as Charlie turns and 
walks towards camera. Suddenly a crisp red 1000 rupee note 
flies out of somewhere and sticks to the side of his face. As 
Charlie tries to shrug it, it darts off.
EXT. RACE COURSE - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY
A playful gambol begins now as the late afternoon breeze 
sails the note across the race course. Charlie pirouettes 
behind, trying to grab at it. Its a little tease as the note 
manages to stay just out of reach.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Mere fapne, mere pyare pyare, chote 
chote dreams.
I/E. RACE COURSE - BETTING RING - SAME
The chase intensifies now as the note tries to duck into some  
dark enclosure. Charlie gives it one final lunge. 
                    7.

As he snatches it out thin air, the lights come on and large 
balloons burst over Charlie’s head, showering him with a hail 
of red currency notes. Its a surprise! 
Charlie looks around and realizes he is in the betting ring. 
The well heeled folk stand all around and clap heartily as 
Charlie is led forward by the motley crowd. The notes keep 
falling out of the sky as a bemused Charlie starts to blush.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Jahaan mein hoon aur mere chaaron 
aur bapu baras hain.. Bimal Jalan, 
C Rangachari, Y V Reddy.. note par 
chape har governor ka naam zabaani 
yaad hai mujhe.. Jo aksar meri 
neendon se mere kaano mein 
gungunaya karte hain... Hum Charlie 
ko jitna chaahe utna rupya ada 
karne ka vachan dete hain..  
As the crowd parts, Charlie sees something square and large, 
wrapped in red chiffon, loom ahead. The same pretty friend 
now appears in view and gifts him a horse whip. Charlie 
accepts it in a daze and walks up to the red box. 
As the cheers behind get lustier, he picks up the whip and 
cracks it right next to the cloth. The cloth starts to slide 
off, revealing a spanking new betting window. Charlie’s eyes 
moisten slightly. 
CHARLIE
Meri jaan.. Mera jahaan.. Meri 
booking window.
The glowing title reads - ”Kismet Associates”.
CUT TO:
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Magar fapne ke baahar main ek 
fhuddu sa gangfter hoon. Hamaara 
gang ghodon ki rafe fix karta hai.
JUMP CUT TO:
EXT. RACE COURSE TRACKS - DAY  
Close shot of horse hoofs as they burn up the turf. Its a 
balmy afternoon, bathed in golden light. 
EXT. RACE COURSE ARENA - PRIVATE BOX - DAY
Charlie stands in a private box and shouts excitedly -
                    8.

CHARLIE
Fanaa! Fanaa! Fanaa!!
Behind him sit two important looking gentlemen, looking 
towards the racing arena through binoculars. We’ll know them 
as MUJIB, 45 and SHUMON, 37. As Fanaa - the race horse - is 
piped at the post, Charlie's face falls. 
The PA System announces the winner glowingly - ‘Blue 
Thunder’. The people in the adjoining box hug and celebrate. 
Mujib and Shumon look impassive as they take off the 
binoculars. 
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Log favorite ghode ke jeetne pe 
paife lagate hain, aur hum haarne 
pe. Kal ki derby mein Blue Thunder 
favorite tha aur yeh rafe fixed 
thi.. maine apne paanch saal ki 
kamaai, ek laakh rupaye usspe 
khela. Magar jockey ne hamaare 
saath double croff kar diya.. Yeh 
fortcut bahut mehnga pada mujhe.
EXT. RACE COURSE - ARENA
Down below, Burgess, the winning jockey takes off his helmet 
and punches the air. He grins, looking at his trainer, 
FRANCIS, 42, ex jockey.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Hamaari booking company ki izzat 
gayi bhi aur luti bhi. company ne 
bhi bahut paisa gavaaya.. Company 
teen bangali bhaiyon ki hai.. ye 
Mujib aur ye fhumon..
EXT. RACE COURSE - PRIVATE BOX - CONTINUOUS
Shumon whispers to Mujib who stares blankly at the arena.
SHUMON
(in Bangla)
Dada.. Uthi..?
CUT TO:
EXT. RAIL YARD - DAY
The chase is on as the lanes keep getting narrower. Charlie 
is gaining upon Burgess, as they both start to tire. 
As Burgess takes a turn he is hit hard on the head. In an 
instant the jockey is knocked out cold on the wet floor. 
                    9.

Charlie stops running as he sees MIKHAIL, 25, emerge from the 
corner. Mikhail grins wickedly at Charlie. 
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Mikhail.. teesra bangali.. mera 
yaar, mere bhai fe bhi zayada apna. 
dil se bachha hai, magar dimaag se 
pagal..
Mikhail walks to Charlie and pulls his cheeks. 
MIKHAIL
Kaifa hai tu..?
Charlie bends down and picks up Mikhail’s pocket watch from 
the ground and opens the dial. The little compartment has 
cocaine stacked inside it. 
CHARLIE
Jaifa hai tu..
Mikhail snorts some of the coke and cleans his nose with the 
sleeve of his jacket.
CUT TO:
INT. BOOKING OFFICE - DAY 
The viewfinder of a spanking new automatic gun pans around a 
cluttered office hall. Bundles and bundles of currency notes, 
lie sloppily on the table.  Phones ring out noisily as a 
couple of workers sit in the distance, taking bets for the 
day's races. We hear a man expounding on the finer qualities 
of the Insas rifle.
ARMS DEALER

through the viewfinder.
SHUMON
Ek round me kitne log mar sakte

ARMS DEALER
(shrugs)
Ginti khatm ho jati hai dada..

                    10.

MUJIB
(in Bangla)
Durbeen ta gondogol..
Shumon looks up from his betting books.
SHUMON
(to Arms Dealer)
Dada kah rahe hain ki viewfinder ka 
alignment theek nahi hai..
The arms dealer takes the gun from Mujib and tries the 
viewfinder. Through it he looks away to an adjacent room 
where a giant plasma beams images from last week’s derby.
INT. BOOKING OFFICE - BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The viewfinder of the gun comes to a stop on Burgess, who 
sits cowering on his seat. He looks bashed up and blood 
trickles from the corner of his mouth. 
CUT TO:
Charlie stands behind Burgess, watching the race intently. 
Mikhail sits slouched on a sofa, and punches the remote 
repeatedly. The screen keeps rewinding to the point where 
Burgess took the lead in the race.
CHARLIE
(sarcastic)
Aife aife kaife kaife ho gaye.. aur 
kaife kaife aife aife ho gaye.. 
Faali badi kaminee cheez hai ye

(to Burgess)
Tujhe ghoda kheenchna tha yahaan..

BURGESS

Charlie towers over him. 
CHARLIE
Kaifa mat kar? Hain..? Tu hamaare 
faath kuch bhi karega.. Hain..? Vo 
fahi hai.. Kal far ke upar aafmaan 
gayab ho gaya tha aur chaddi ke 
andar famaan..! kitna loff hua

Burgess looks away. Charlie grabs him and forces him to turn 
towards him. 
                    11.

CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Kab fe kaam kar rahaa hai tu 
hamaare liye..?
BURGESS
(sobbing)
4 saal..
CHARLIE
Hmm.. koi takleef..? Koi pareshani 
kabhi..?
Burgess shakes his head. Mikhail keeps watching the t.v. 
quietly.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
Fir kyun..? Kifke kehne pe..?
BURGESS
Vo log maar dalenge mujhe..
MIKHAIL
(turns sharply)
Aur hum to pooja karenge teri..!

Burgess gasps.

In the other room, Mujib re checks the viewfinder of the

from inside it. He shows it to Mikhail.

MIKHAIL
Thoda chota hai..
CHARLIE
Ye bhi kaun sa lamba hai
MIKHAIL

Burgess looks at them haplessly as the two start to argue.
MIKHAIL
Kaise.. Mundi ek.. do haath.. 
Teen.. pair pure
CHARLIE
Aadhe..
MIKHAIL
Char teen saat to yahin ho gai.. 
Dur badachod.. Dusra bag manga..
Burgess breaks down and falls on Charlie’s feet. Charlie 
grabs him by his hair.
CHARLIE
Fuar ke bacche.. kapde fatein hai

Burgess looks at Charlie and wipes his tears.

SHUMON
(Bangla)
Fattu..! Shonamoni..! Chil gayi

towards Mujib. Mujib keeps staring at them blankly . Suddenly 
he breaks into a loud chuckle and all three brothers begin to 
fool around.

TINA

Mikhail turns to the other one, puzzled.
MIKHAIL
Who is she..?
REAL TINA

The twins giggle as Mikhail looks at them quizzically. His 
cell phone rings out and he takes the call.
CHARLIE

Visual freeze on Charlie’s face.
CUT TO:
EXT. KAMATHIPURA STREET - EVENING
Song - ‘Phatak.’
GUDDU, Charlie’s twin, performs a robust street theatre 
number in the slums. The setting is a red light area and a 
large crowd has turned out to see the NGO sponsored play.
Guddu wears a mask around his face with two large funny ears 
made out of condom balloons. As he regales everyone with his 
antics, Guddu holds forth on the merits of safe sex and 
advocates protection to all. The song seems to connect big 
time with the assembled sex workers and is a rousing success. 
Through the sea of smiling faces, we see SWEETY, a lovely 
young girl in her early twenties. Guddu is in his element,  
distributing sachets of condoms everywhere, chanting the 
slogan - 
GUDDU
Yeh ishq nahi aasaan.. Ik aag ka 
dariya hai aur ye aapki naiyya 
hai..
As he notices Sweety, he starts performing even more 
animatedly. 
GUDDU
Ik aag ka dariya hai aur ye aapki 
naiyya hai..
SWEETY

GUDDU(CONT’D)
Bataya kyun nahi mujhe? Matlab..
SWEETY

Guddu is getting edgier and Sweety would rather not confront 
him. She turns away. Guddu holds her and forces her to face 
him directly. 
GUDDU

Guddu tries to utter the remaining syllables with all his 
might but can’t. Sweety tries to figure out what he’s unable 
to say.

Guddu and Sweety, both slightly tipsy, inside a tent. Sweety 
waits impatiently for Guddu on the mattress while he rummages 
through the bags looking desperately for something. 
SWEETY
Ab main so jaungi Guddu..
Guddu doesn’t react.
SWEETY
Chodo na..
GUDDU
Matlab yaheen toh tha.. Maine pack 
kiya tha.. Apne haathon se.. Poore 
5 ka pack tha matlab..
Sweety can’t wait anymore. She gets up and stops him, until 
she has his complete attention.  
SWEETY
Mein home science ki topper hoon..
GUDDU
matlab..
Sweety puts a finger on his lips.
SWEETY
Matlab..  aaj koi khatra nahi 
hai..waise bhi hum dono ke beech 
koi teesra achha nahi lagta mujhe..
Guddu is still unsure. Sweety holds his face gently in her 
palms and comes really close to him. 
SWEETY
(whispers)
Achha hai kho gaya chaila..! Jaante 
ho is ke baad kitne door ho jaate 
hain hum..? jaise ke mein New York 
mein hoon aur tum New.. New.. 
                    19.

The word gets stuck as Sweety starts to stammer.
GUDDU
New Jersey..?
SWEETY
(shaking her head)
New.. New..
GUDDU
New Zealand..?
SWEETY
(relieved)
New Bombay..
GUDDU
(smiling)
Bombay nahi Mumbai..
SWEETY
You love Mumbai..?
GUDDU
Hmmmm..
SWEETY
But I love you more than 
Mumbai..Chennai..Kolkata..Bengaluru
..Thiruvantha..tha..
As Sweety again starts to stammer, Guddu brings his face 
close to her.
They kiss passionately as the lights go dim. 
CUT TO:
INT. GUDDU’S HOSTEL ROOM - EVENING
Guddu’s natty hostel room. Camera travels from a large poster 
advocating safe sex to find Guddu sitting on the bed. Sweety 
stands near the window and speaks on the phone.
SWEETY
Kah raha hai ki ek din mein sab ho 
jayega. Char ghante mein main ghar 
vapas ja sakti hoon.. Sameday.. Kal 
ka time loon..? Guddu.. Jawaab do 
yaar.. Doctor hold kar raha hai.. 
Guddu speaks while holding his head in between his palms.
                    20.

GUDDU
Jo karna hai karo...main is murder 
mein tumhara saath nahi doonga.. 
matlab..
Sweety cuts the line.
SWEETY
Matlab..?
There is a silent beat of silence. Sweety slowly smiles.
SWEETY (CONT’D)
Samjhi..! Tum insaan nahi devta ho 
Guddu..devta... main tumhare bacche 
ki maa banne ko taiyaar hoon..
Guddu sharply turns and screams.
GUDDU
Par mujhe abhi baap nahi ban na 
hai..!!
He violently folds his hand & grits his teeth.
GUDDU (CONT’D)
Meri maa tu samajhti kyun nahi 
hai...Diploma khatm hone mein abhi 
ek saal baki hai aur NGO ke part 
time se to padai ka kharcha bhi 
badi mushkil se poora ho pata 
hai..khud ko paalne ki aukat nahi 
hai... Bachha kahan se palenge...
Sweety comes closer to him and holds him lovingly.
SWEETY
Ho jayega.. Har koi duniya mein 
apni kismat khud leke aata hai.
Guddu bursts out.
GUDDU
Kismat ki toh lag gayi hai matlab.. 
already.Main abhi shaadi nahi kar 
sakta...
SWEETY
Kyun..?
Guddu flips a calander on the wall
He flings her the calender on the back of which is a detailed 
plan of his life. A sort of schedule. Sweety looks at it 
curiously. It says : 
Diploma : 2009
                    21.

Naukri : 2010
Tarakki : 2012
Pyar/Shaadi : 2014
Baccha(1): 2016
Videsh(USA, London or Australia) : 2020
SWEETY (CONT’D)
(sarcastic)
Shaadi 2014 mein magar suhaagraat 
2009 mein.. wah Sharmaji wah..
GUDDU
Vo tum chahti thi..
Guddu tries to walk out of the room. Sweety stops him.
SWEETY
Aur tum? Tum nahi chahte the..?
Guddu looks at her for a bit. Sweety waits expectantly.
GUDDU
Nahi..
He walks away.
SWEETY
(loudly)
To maine rape kiya tha tumhara..?!
INT. GUDDU’S HOSTEL - CORRIDOR - LATER
Guddu’s hostel mates loitering in the corridor outside the 
room, react to Sweety’s allegation. A visibly embarrassed 
Guddu chooses to ignore her and keeps walking in the 
corridor. Sweety follows him.
SWEETY
Aur vo saari baatein..? Vo bhi sab 
nashe mein kahi thi?
(mimicking Guddu)
Baba.. aisa lagta hai jaise mein 
tumhe do mahine nahi do janmon se 
jaanta hoon..
She runs ahead of Guddu and stops him. They look at each 
other in silence. A beat.
SWEETY (CONT’D)
Please baba.. main bhi koi naukri 
kar loongi..
GUDDU
Magar main phir bhi abhi shaadi 
nahi kar sakta.. matlab..
                    22.

He walks away again.
SWEETY
Kya matlab haan..? har baat mein 
matlab matlab.. Na abortion tumhe 
manzoor hai aur na shaadi... Karna 
kya chahte ho tum..?
GUDDU
Marna chahta hoon...
INT. GUDDU’S HOSTEL - BATHROOM - LATER
Guddu walks into the bathroom and shuts the door behind him. 
He slumps into the commode seat, his head buried in his 
hands. 
INT. GUDDU’S HOSTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Outside, Sweety knocks on the door. 
SWEETY
Guddu please.. I love you Guddu.. 
Please.. main tumhe marta nahi dekh 
sakti..
GUDDU
Khudkhushi nahi kar raha hoon 
main..
SWEETY
(sobbing)
Jaanti hoon.. Par shaam tak shaadi 
nahi hui to tumhara murder ho 
jayega..
She sobs even louder now. Inside Guddu looks up at the door, 
puzzled.
SWEETY
Tum nahi jaante aur maine tumse 
chupaya bhi hai.. Mera poora naam 
Sweety Shekhar Bhope hai aur mein.. 
Sunil chopper Bhope ki sagi behen 
hoon..
Guddu opens the door slowly. Shocked. Pale.
GUDDU
Bho.. Bho.. Bho..
Sweety wipes her tears and comes close to him. 
SWEETY
Haan baba..Bhope..
                    23.

She hugs him as he stands lifeless in the corridor.

THE MAKING OF BHOPE 
In a quick voice-over montage, we are taken through the life 
and ascent of this vicious, hardboiled man who we’ll come to 
know as BHOPE, a dreaded gangster turned corporator from the 
slums.
JUMP CUT TO:
INT. BHOPE'S CHAWL - BHOPE’S MANSION - EVENING 
A mousy looking Doctor sits across a table as a heavyset 
toughie, GANESH, recounts the ‘The making of Bhope’.
GANESH
To ye hai Maharashtra ki mitti ka 
veer maratha putr Sunil Shekhar 
Bhope..
As he finishes up, the door flies open and a boy, 6 years of 
age, enters the room and looks around. A hand runs through 
the boy’s hair and we see Bhope enter from behind the child.
BHOPE
Jai Maharashtra..
ALL
(getting up)
Jai Maharashtra..
Bhope sits on a chair as Ganesh starts to prepare an 
injection. 
The boy busies himself with a remote controlled toy car. 
Bhope rubs iodine tincture on a part of his stomach with a 
cotton. Ganesh hands over the insulin injection to him. 
GANESH
Bhau.. Doctor.. Sweety ki report 
yahi laya hai..
The Doctor shows Sweety’s pregnancy report to Bhope. He goes 
through it as he pokes himself with the syringe. 
BHOPE

DOCTOR

BHOPE

The Doctor thanks him profusely and leaves the room. Ganesh 
takes out a machine used to measure Bhope’s blood sugar 
level. The kid walks up to Bhope. 
BOY
Mala chocolate paije..! 
( I want a chocolate)
GANESH
College gaya tha ladka.. ek mahine 
se Sweety college gayi hi nahi 
hai.. guthli..
BHOPE
Mulga..?

Ganesh pricks on Bhope’s middle finger ever so slightly and 
takes out a drop of blood. The kid pulls on Bhope’s kurta, 
demanding for the chocolate. 
BOY
Chocolate paije..!
( I want a chocolate).! 
GANESH
Koi guddu hai..
BHOPE

Ganesh looks at the machine carefully as it measures the 
sugar. 
GANESH

BOY

BHOPE

The boy leaves the room crying. Bhope picks up his cell phone 
and starts to walk out. 
BHOPE
Chala gaadi kaad..!
GANESH
Bhau nahi..Pandhrah saal lag gaye 
kaalikh saaf karte karte.. Main jaa

her heart out as Guddu looks in the distance.

Sweety keeps quiet.
GUDDU (CONT’D)
Hmmm... Kyun bola jhooth..?
Guddu turns her head gently towards him.
                    26.

GUDDU (CONT’D)
Vishvaas nahi tha mera..? Matlab...
A beat of silence.
GUDDU (CONT’D)
Tum Bhope bhau nahi dawood bhai ki 
behen bhi hoti toh bhi itta sa farq 
nahi padta mujhe..samjhi..
She buries her face in her palms and cries. Guddu melts a 
bit. He presses on her shoulder with concern but she shakes 
his hand away vigorously. He picks up a glass of water and 
offers it to her. 
GUDDU (CONT’D)
Lo paani pee lo..
SWEETY
Thoda zeher bhi mila do na is

GUDDU
Phir toh mar jaogi tum.. Haan..?
SWEETY
Achha hai.. Tumhara peecha toh

Sweety isn’t moved by Guddu’s attempt to lighten things up.
GUDDU (CONT’D)
Par ek gadbad hai.. bhooton ke 
bacche paida hote hai ki nahi..?
This time Sweety laughs despite the tears. She picks up the 
glass and throws water at Guddu. He smiles, drenched.
GUDDU (CONT’D)
Batao kab karni hai shaadi..?
SWEETY
(wiping her tears)
Aaj.. Abhi..
Sweety’s cell phone rings out. Guddu looks at her dumbstruck. 
She wipes her tears and takes the call.

from the suddenness of news. 
GUDDU

A ball comes rolling towards them. Guddu’s gang looks at them 
expectantly.
SWEETY (CONT’D)

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Charlie walks along with Steve and Kranti. A flight purser 
with a guitarcase in his hand approaches from the opposite 
side. As they pass each other the purser gives a courteous 
smile to the group. The camera leaves Charlie and co. And 
begins to follow the purser, who stops in front of a room. He 
presses the button to the doorbell...there is no response 
from inside. He places his ear at the door to hear if there 
is any movement inside...As he rests his body up against the 
door to listen, it slowly creaks open. Upon realizing that 
the door was unlocked, the purser is intrigued. He steps 
inside hesitantly.
PURSER
Naarang Saab...?
There is no response again, as he walks further inside the 
suite, he crosses the living room. He peeps inside the 
bedroom and freezes on the spot, on seeing three people...A 
white couple and a portly middle aged Indian man lying dead 
inside. He panics and turns to find ARVIND LELE, 36 and GARY 
LOBO, 42 standing with their hands up, holding pistols in

A fairly big yacht guarded by a few gunmen, slowly moves in 
the middle of the ocean, against the setting sun...We see a 
bare bodied Tashi in shorts standing on the deck, sporting 
sunglasses and a hat...He feeds bread crumbs to seagulls that 
follow his vessel. Afghani who holds the plate full of bread 
crumbs, gets a phone call. He signals one of the gunmen to 
grab the plate. Afghani takes a few steps back to take the 
call
AFGHANI

The scene is now intercut between him and Lobo, Lele inside

feeding the seagulls...He softly speaks into his ears
AFGHANI

kehna chahta hai...
Tashi nods, Afghani puts the phone on speaker.
AFGHANI (CONT'D)
Haan bol...
Lobo takes his cellphone close to the purser and whispers.
LOBO
Tashi...
The purser, doesn’t know what to say, and keeps crying. Lele 
prompts him hurriedly.
LELE
Bhow...bhow...
The purser tries to bark like a dog. Lele takes the phone and 
speaks.
LELE (CONT'D)
Tashi saab, yeh kehna chah raha hai

Tashi speaks while throwing the crumbs into the sea.
TASHI

Afghani ends the call on his cell.

Francis shuts the door as his friends leave. He walks towards

He walks into the bathroom and lifts the commode seat; 
piddling and humming his tune without a care in the world. He 
finishes and flushes the tank. As he turns around, Francis 
lets out a stifled scream as he faces Charlie. Charlie 
punches him hard on the nose and Francis goes tumbling onto 
the wall. 
CHARLIE
Aife aife kaife kaife ho gaye..
Francis turns to the door to run out but is punched hard by 
Steve who keeps vigil there. Francis is pushed back and he 
slumps inside the bathtub. Charlie grabs him by his hair and 
turns his face towards the tap. Water gushes out in full 
force and Francis gasps for air.

the floor. 
Charlie and Steve make a dash for it as the goons recover and 
set off after them. 
They criss-cross dazed bell boys and jump around other

corner of the parking lot, leaves them startled and LOBO 
walks across the vehicle to inspect the commotion, while Lele 
follows after closing the door. 
Lele’s only taken a few steps when Steve comes running of 
nowhere and collides straight into him. Lele is knocked out 
with the impact. They both come crashing down.

Lele hits the floor hard. Charlie runs towards them and tries 
to help Steve up, who now lies buried under Lele’s lifeless 
torso. 
Lobo, who was watching this bizarre turn of events from his 
rear view, rushes out of the jeep to help his friend. Kranti 
comes running from the back and slugs him cold. He gets into 
the jeep and honks at Charlie. The gangsters’ footsteps are 
closer now. It’s a split second decision. Charlie climbs in 
and puts the jeep in gear. 
It’s barely moved a few paces when suddenly, Lele’s bloodied 
face appears at the half open window. Charlie freaks and 
races the pedal. Lele is dragged along with the jeep for some 
distance. As the power windows come on, his fingers fall away 
and he drops off. Lele takes off his shoe and hurls it at the 
jeep as it vanishes into the night.

Sweety. 
We see that the marriage preparations have begun in full 
swing. Guddu’s colleagues start to deck up the hostel 
entrance with flowers and decorations. A sulking Guddu gets 
into a modest achkan and borrowed pyjamas.

They drive past unhindered. Charlie’s friends are puzzled.

Charlie’s getaway jeep screeches to a stop on the side of the 
road. Kranti jumps off in a hurry and inspects the front of 
the jeep. A small plate just above the license plate reads, 
‘Anti Narcotics Cell’. He looks up in shock at the others. 
Kranti starts running in the opposite direction. Soon enough, 
Steve scampers out of the jeep. Charlie looks on haplessly. 
CHARLIE
Abbe fafuron..! Kahaan ja rahe 
ho..?! Ruko faalon..!!
                    37.

The light has turned green by now and the traffic constable 
starts whistling. Charlie drives off in a daze.

The audience applauds as Tashi ends his performance,prominent 
among them Afghani, who cheers lustily. We see a pretty 
African lady, VIVIAN, Tashi’s wife in her thirties flanked by 
TANO, their seven year old boy. They give him a standing 
ovation. 
TASHI

This was for Vivian..
GUEST

Well.. Yeah friends.. ye dil se

Tano! Get your mommy up on stage! 
C’mon..
The audience cheers as Tano escorts his mother onto the 
stage. Tashi picks the child up on his arms.
                    40.

TASHI
You know where I first met your 
mom?
Tano shakes his head.
TASHI
In a museum in Cairo.. I was lost 
in her while she was lost in this..
Tashi pulls the strings of a curtain behind as he speaks. The 
curtain falls off to reveal a large painting. A celebrated 
work of African folk art. Vivian stares dumbstruck.
TASHI
(whispers)
Remember this baby..?
Vivian hugs her husband.
VIVIAN
(emotional)
How.. How did you get it here?
TASHI
I didn’t... He did.
Vivian looks at Tashi quizzically. As Tashi points behind 
her, she turns around to see a portly African businessman, 
RAGOS, 43, smiling at her.
VIVIAN
Ragos..!
RAGOS
Happy anniversary Sis..!
Vivian hugs her brother.
VIVIAN

I love you baby.. You’re a devil.. 
You know that..!?
The family reunites cheerfully as another African gentleman, 
Cajetan, smiles at them from behind the stage.

Bhope’s men systematically ransack the NGO office. Ganesh 
settles in one of the cushy chairs as the rioters turn the 
place upside down. One of the employees cowers on the floor, 
near him.
                    41.

As he chills quietly, Ganesh suddenly spots a picture of 
Guddu and Sweety which has emerged on one of the computer 
screen savers. He freaks out and calls out to his associates. 
As they converge near the machine, the image blanks out. 
Ganesh panics and starts banging the monitor hard. The image 
comes on again. 
The NGO employee starts shaking with fear as Ganesh turns to 
him.  
INT. BHOPE'S CHAWL - BHOPE’S MANSION - NIGHT
A TV crew prepares for an interview with Bhope. A make up man 
works on Bhope who takes special interest in covering up the 
bags under his eyes. A man walks into the room with a mobile 
phone. Bhope looks at him as the man rubs the phone on the 
sleeve of his shirt and places it against Bhope’s ears. The 
Make up artist carries on.
BHOPE

Song - ‘Raat ke dhai baje’ Near the hostel gate, one girl 
finishes chalking a message on a black board - ‘GUDDU weds 
SWEETY! Tonight 8pm. F block Amphitheatre.’ 
As we follow the festivities around, we see mehndi being 
applied on Sweety’s hands. Her upbeat mood vastly contrasts 
Guddu’s surly expressions. She works on the internet with her 
free hand, buying air tickets. 
Some of her friends tease her about the pregnancy. Her face 
looks giddy with anticipation.

EXT. DOCK AREA - PARKING - NIGHT
Charlie parks the car in an abandoned parking lot behind the 
Gateway. He quickly frisks it for any traces of evidence. 
                    43.

He fishes his hand inside the ashtray and finds a small 
compartment under it. As he opens it, his hands grip some 
cold metal. He brings it out. Its a gun. He puts it back 
quickly and shuts the compartment. 
He searches some more and finds the ID cards of the two Anti 
Narcotics cops. Charlie freezes for a second and then throws 
it away. 
Without missing a beat, he starts rummaging through the rest 
of the car furiously. He reaches out under the back seat and 
finds a guitar case lodged under the back seat. He zips it 
open and takes out a beautiful cedar wooded flamenco guitar. 
Charlie turns it upside down but can’t make anything of it. 
Finally he hurls it back in the case and the false bottom 
opens magically.
Charlie can’t believe his eyes. Large stacks of cocaine lie 
arranged in neat compartments. He takes out his pocket knife 
and slits a pack. No sooner than he’s tasted it, he panics. 
He sits in the quiet stillness of the car with cold sweat 
streaming down his face. In a flash, he shuts the case, zips 
it up and puts it under from where he found it. He hurriedly 
stumbles out of the car, locks it up and flings the key far 
towards the tetrapods. 
He walks away briskly, the cool breeze feeling nice on his 
cold skin.
EXT. DOCK AREA - ROAD - CONTINUOUS
As Charlie hits the main road, a horse buggy comes neighing 
in from the distance. Charlie looks on transfixed as it comes 
close and crosses the frame on the other side of the road. 
The buggy has no rider on it! Suddenly it disappears around 
the corner and there’s complete silence. Charlie looks all 
around but there’s not a soul to be seen. 
Gradually he starts to walk away but his face looks tortured 
with thought. His pace begins to slacken and all of a sudden, 
he turns and sprints back in the direction of the tetrapods. 
He reaches the far end and starts scrounging through the 
litter like a madman.

marriage party with folded hands. They move to the centre 
where the ceremony is in progress. The priest conducts the 
ceremony around the fire. 
                    44.

Sweety goes pale on seeing her brothers’ henchman but Ganesh 
smiles at her lovingly. He smiles at Guddu and sits next to 
him.
GANESH
Bhauzi.. Me tumcha meuna..

Guddu tries to smile as he shifts a look to Sweety. The 
priest hesitates but Ganesh gestures to him to carry on with 
the ceremony.

Camera follows them as they enter the control room where 
fuzzy CCTV footage of the earlier corridor chase scene plays 
out on a monitor.  Lobo & Lele watch curiously as Charlie and 
gang run the place upside down.
Lobo asks the operator to zoom in. A techno number starts on

the screen.

INT. CHARLIE’S YARD - TRAILER - NIGHT
We open on a close of the guitar case as it lies under the 
bed in Charlie’s trailer. The camera moves slowly through the 
room - from the bed to the CD player and finally to the 
bathroom where furious activity can be traced behind the 
plastic curtain. 
Inside, Charlie is grooving to the beats in his makeshift 
shower cage. As the cool water hits him, he shows off his 
dance moves like a pro.
He finishes showering, wraps a towel around him and waltzes 
towards the back door. A train whizzes past, he unwraps the 
towel and flashes himself, screaming away in bliss.

safe where Charlie stores cash and other valuables. He counts 
the money and replaces the brick on the wall.

EXT. GUDDU’S HOSTEL - SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT
The Mandap lies smashed to pieces. The place looks deserted 
except for a few crumpled bodies here and there. Sweety is 
being dragged away by Ganesh’s men while he thrashes semi-
conscious Guddu lying smashed up on the cement. 
Sweety’s scream tears through the air.
SWEETY
Tujhya aaichya..! haath sod kaka..! 
kaka haath sod.. Me maarun taakin 
kaka..! haath sod..!!
(Your mother’s..!Leave my hand kaka..!Leave my hand..I’ll 
kill you kaka..! leave my hand..!!) 
She somehow manages to free herself and runs towards Ganesh. 
She grabs him by the hair and bites into his arm. The goons 
push her away from Ganesh and she stumbles back and falls 
near the fire. Ganesh looks at his wound and directs his 
anger towards Guddu. 
By now Sweety has recovered and she grabs a burning log from 
the fire. She screams in unbridled rage and pounds at 
Ganesh’s leg with the burning wood. Ganesh writhes in pain as 
Sweety smashes his leg to pulp. She turns to the other goons 
and swings out at them, throwing the choicest  Marathi 
expletives. The goons only try to protect themselves, unable 
to put Sweety to any harm. 
Guddu watches this stunned, having never witnessed this side 
of Sweety. 
SWEETY
Bag utha Guddu..!

Tashi caresses it in his lap, Ragos smiles -

himself.
Tashi is overwhelmed by the gesture - 
TASHI
I love it! Thanks guys..! Wow! This 
means a lot!
CAJETAN

Tashi looks up quizzically as Cajetan picks up the horn and 
smashes it against the floor. The horn breaks into two and 
from inside two identical diamonds spill out.
Cajetan grins and holds up the stones close to Tashi. Tashi 
is dumbstruck as he beholds the twins. 
                    49.

TASHI

As Tashi reaches out to hold the diamond, Cajetan closes his 
fist and does a sleight-of-hand. He opens the fist but the 
diamonds are gone. 
CAJETAN

Tashi’s face clouds over but he manages a smile.

C‘mon brother..! Don’t be an

Kya hua..?
Guddu whispers.
GUDDU
Chati class mein fail hote hote 
bach gaya tha mein...
SWEETY
Haan..?

GUDDU
Ek hi bench mein baitha karte the

SWEETY

GUDDU

Ahmed... I was in love with her... 
Use mujhse kahaniya sunana pasand 
tha... Champak, Nandan, Bela

Sweety’s face goes pale but she tries to carry on normally.
SWEETY
Dekho ye kahani tum mujhe andar 
chal ke bhi su..su..su...
Guddu smiles
GUDDU
Achanak yaad aya na ki.. Atakna

Vahaan kurukshetra ke maidaan mein 
kya hua tha? bhool gayi thi..?
Kyun kar rahi ho ye naatak mere

Sweety looks away..
GUDDU (CONT’D)
 Aur kitne jhooth baaki hain 
abhi..?
Sweety realizes that her stammer act is of no use any longer. 
SWEETY
(crying)
Mere har jhooth ki niyat sachhi hai 
Guddu..
GUDDU
Jhooth...
                    57.

SWEETY

Jaldi kya hai..? Pehle tumhe theek

Stuck on the car dashboard is the sketch of a wanted criminal

Tumhara bachha hai mere bheetar..
GUDDU

Sweety is broken into pieces inside by Guddu’s vicious 
attack. 
SWEETY
Jiyu ghein tuzha halkat..!
She walks away from him, crying. As she walks there is some 
commotion behind. She turns around and sees that Guddu is 
being dragged away into a Police vehicle. 
Sweety screams out and run frantically towards the police 
car.

Charlie runs into a narrow alley close to his yard. Mikhail’s 
car is just behind him but Charlie does not give him any room 
to overtake. Mikhail swerves and squeezes the car ahead of 
Charlie who gets into a corner to save himself. 
                    58.

Mikhail wins the race and Charlie is left in a pool of mud. 
Mikhail comes out of the car, laughing triumphantly. 
Mikhail is ecstatic as he shows the time to Charlie. 
MIKHAIL
Fpiderman fpiderman..
Mikhail sits next to Charlie on the ground. Charlie is still 
reeling under shock from the recent adventure.
CHARLIE

a little jig on the way.

Charlie walks towards the watch tower but stops as he crosses 
his trailer. The lights are on and he can hear the TV playing 
inside. He frowns and walks to the door. He opens it and is 
stunned to see the scene inside.

INT. CHARLIE’S YARD - TRAILER - CONTINUOUS
ETV Marathi plays a raunchy number on the small TV but the 
image is blurry - Ganesh adjusts the antenna. A man stands 
next to the stove, his hands covered in vada-pav batter. In 
the center of the room, reclining easy on the hammock, is 
Bhope.
He looks up at Charlie, smiling cheerfully.
                    59.

BHOPE
Ya ya ya Sharma ji basaa basaa..

(Come come come Sharmaji sit sit..)
(Hot vada-pav in the pouring rain.. Sit sit..)
Charlie is yet to take it all in. He looks at Bhope dumbly 
who plucks out an old school photo of the brothers. He waves 
the picture at Charlie. 
BHOPE
Asal mein hum dulhe raja ko dhund 
rahe hain..
CHARLIE
Ji kife..?
Ganesh takes out his gun and makes a big show of placing it 
on the TV. Magically, it makes the antenna start working and 
the men CHEER as the Marathi sex-pot dancing on ETV becomes 
clear. 
GANESH
Guddu ko..
BHOPE
Kitne bhai ho tum log..?
CHARLIE
Do..
BHOPE
Teen hote toh kya moochh ukhaad

Ganesh and the other goons giggle at their boss’ joke.
BHOPE
Behen hai koi..?

BHOPE
(sarcastic)
Koi nahi.. Mujhe bhi nahi 
bulaya..khair.. kahaan milega..?
A car horn is heard in the distance. Charlie is distracted 
momentarily but composes himself. 
CHARLIE
Dekhiye maine do faal fe fakal bhi 
nahi dekhi hai uski.. aur abhi kifi 
khaaf kaam fe bahar jana hai

Fell number kya hai apna..?
Bhope is amused at Charlie’s lisp. 
BHOPE
Kya number..?
Charlie waves his cell phone.
CHARLIE
Fell..? mobile..
Bhope bursts into a raucous laughter.
BHOPE
Tu totlaa hai..?
CHARLIE

A couple of African men are in an intense argument with a

constable tries to keep them down but loses it eventually. He 
abuses loudly in Marathi and asks his junior to keep the 
Nigerians at bay as he walks away.

Charlie’s pictures from the CCTV grabs of the hotel escapade 
are pinned around on a board. Prateek jots down details on 
the board, trying to establish a connection between Charlie, 
the cocaine in question and the drug mafias in the city. 
Afghani’s name features prominently in the list.

Prateek salutes them and escorts them inside.

be some confusion.
They walk into the interrogation cell where Guddu sits alone 
on a chair. He looks at them and gets up angrily. 
GUDDU
Aap log kuch batate kyon nahi 
hai..? Kyun laya gaya hai mujhe 
yahaan..? Aise bina vajah bina 
warrant kaise aap kisi ko hirasat

He sees that the cops are looking at him very carefully. Lobo 
turns to Prateek.
LOBO
We’ll take it from here.. Thanks..
                    62.

Prateek leaves the room reluctantly. Lobo bolts the door 
behind while Lele keeps staring at Guddu.
GUDDU

Ye ka ka.. kaanoon ke khi.. khi..

LELE
Khilaaf hai..?
Guddu nods. Lele slaps him all of a sudden. Guddu falls on 
the floor.
LELE

Lele bends down and grabs Guddu by the hair. 
LELE

Before Charlie could finish his sentence, Mikhail makes a 
sudden dramatic entry into the trailer. Bhope and his goons 
gape at him. Mikhail immediately whips his pistol out. Ganesh 
goes for his pistol but Bhope stops him. 
Mikhail surveys the scene quietly and his gaze stops at 
Charlie.

Mikhail accepts the offer cautiously. Bhope’s man brings a 
plate full of vada-pav from inside the kitchen. 
BHOPE (CONT’D)
Thodi bhookh lagi toh bas vada paav

He offers the snack to Mikhail who picks one.

unmoved and clasps onto Guddu even more firmly. Guddu spots 
Charlie trussed up between Bhope and his goons. He gives him 
a disgusted look. Charlie also looks back defiantly at him.
Lobo gestures at Bhope to send the quarries across. Lele

other end, Charlie starts screaming and kicking. Ganesh and 
his men separate Charlie and start to drag him across. The 
two brothers come face to face. Suddenly, the door opens and 
a TT looks in. He’s shocked at the elaborate set up and 
everybody freezes. The train begins to move and before anyone 
can react, the TT is dragged into the moving train by Lobo. 
In the ensuing confusion, Charlie whips out Ganesh’s gun and 
pushing Guddu down, grabs Sweety. He puts a gun on her head 
and starts screaming - 
CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Ae fab peeche hato..! Varna bheja 
uda doonga ladki ka..! Hato..!
Lobo & Lele train their guns at Charlie.
LELE
Ae saale..! Khopdi uda doonga hila 
to..!
Charlie ducks behind Sweety as Bhope takes out his gun and 
points it at Lobo & Lele.
BHOPE
Ae paandu..! Pistol hata meri behen 
se..!
Lobo in turn, turns around and cocks his gun at Bhope. 
CHARLIE
(to Ganesh)
Oye..! Chain kheech faale.. 
kheench..! Train rok..!
                    75.
CHARLIE (cont'd)

The TT suddenly starts having a seizure. The train starts to 
slow down as Ganesh pulls the chain. 
Charlie quietly inches his way towards the rear door with his 
gun still plugged into Sweety. As Charlie takes baby steps 
back, Guddu gets up and slugs him from behind. Charlie loses 
his grip and comes crashing to the floor. All the screaming 
comes to a stop as everyone is stunned by this sudden anti-
climax. 
Guddu glares at his brother. Lobo & Lele come into action and 
confiscate the weapon, taking charge of Charlie. They gesture 
towards Bhope and almost immediately, Bhope and his men 
surround Guddu and Sweety. Bhope hugs Sweety who’s still 
shaking with fear while Ganesh and his men seize Guddu. 
INT. LAST TRAIN STATION - CONTINUOUS 
The train arrives at the next station. As they are bundled 
off at the platform, Guddu looks back. 
Charlie is sprawled by the door. As his eyelids start to fall 
shut, he can barely make out a blurry figure of Guddu as he 
is dragged away. Lobo bends down and smacks Charlie in the 
face. The screen goes black.

Charlie is being dragged along the floor as we see him 
handcuffed to the side of Lobo and Lele’s jeep. The rain 
lashes across the highway as the jeep rumbles onto a deserted 
patch of road. 
As Lobo keeps playing with the accelerator, the jeep moves in 
violent fits and starts. Charlie is panting for breath as 
Lele jeers at him continuously. Suddenly Lobo presses the 
brakes and Charlie’s head hits the side of the jeep.

An anxious looking Guddu sits sandwiched in the back seat. 
Ganesh and another goon sit on either side. Its a silent

Suddenly, out of nowhere, Ganesh whacks him from the left. As 
Guddu turns sharply in his direction, the other goon whacks 
him from the right. Guddu’s head stings with pain as he tries 
to cower. The driver, who’s watching all this bullying from 
the rear view, chuckles as the car roars into the chawl.
EXT. BHOPE'S CHAWL - MORNING
An entourage of ambassadors thunder into the chawl. A couple 
of police jeeps stand nearby for surveillance. The policemen 
salute smartly as Bhope and Sweety, who cries deeply, get off 
from the first car and march in. Guddu follows behind, 
escorted by Ganesh and his men. The huge steel gates of the 
chawl shut close.

As the procession marches forward, Guddu looks up and sees 
people peeping out of the shanties. All along the lanes, 
shacks are piled atop each other, like a deck of cards. He 
can feel a thousand stares piercing into him. The rain keeps 
coming down and there’s practically no trace of sunlight as 
the lanes keep getting narrower and narrower. 
Finally the entourage reaches a three storeyed house with 
machine gun toting men guarding it. Guddu is ushered inside 
brusquely.

Furious rains lash out on the highway floor. The wipers 
struggle to keep some visibility going on in the harsh

Inside the van, a small trickle of blood oozes from Charlie’s 
nose yet he shows no sign of pain. The van moves on an 
isolated road.  
LELE
Yahaan se left loon ya right..?
LOBO

Kahaan lein..?
CHARLIE

LOBO
Phir kahaan hai..?
Charlie doesn’t reply. Lele smacks Charlie. 
LELE

Jawaab de..!
Lobo takes out his service revolver.
LOBO
(whispers to Lele)
Left le.. ye kachhe raaste pe..
The van swerves to a left on the dirt track. A small 
overflowing gutter runs on the left while there is a deserted 
field on the right. The van hobbles on the muddy road 
splashing water over the puddles. 
LOBO (CONT’D)
Ye nala dekh raha hai..? Teri laash

Lobo hits Charlie again.
LOBO

Tumhara bharofa nahi hai mujhe..
As Charlie speaks the van comes to an abrupt halt, jerking 
violently. Charlie and Lobo lose balance and fall on Lele. 
The right tire of the van is stuck in a large pothole. Lele 
accelerates but the van refuses to move. 
LELE
Bhaiya zaraa dekhna kahaan atkaa 
hai..?
Lobo tucks his pistol as he gets off. He looks at the tire. 
LOBO
Thoda right ghuma steering.. haan 
ab back kar..
Lele makes another attempt but the engine wails and comes to 
a stop. 
LOBO
Achha seedha kar.. thoda left.. 
Thoda aur.. bas bas..
As Lele follows Lobo’s instructions, the tire skids wildly 
before jumping out of the puddle all of a sudden. Before Lele 
can control it, the van hits Lobo standing by. Boom! The gun 
tucked under Lobo’s shirt goes off all of a sudden as he 
flies away and falls a few feet away in a pool of mud. Lele 
lets out a short scream and scampers out of the vehicle. 
LELE
Bhaiya..!!

Lele is stunned to see Lobo bleeding profusely on the ground. 
He runs to him and puts Lobo’s head on his lap, trying to 
bring him back to consciousness. 
Inside the van, Charlie bends forward and takes out a pistol 
from the secret compartment. 
Outside, Lele cries over a semi-conscious Lobo as Charlie 
gets off the car in the background and approaches the cops, 
the pistol raised towards them.

In the inner courtyard of Bhope’s mansion, Bhope stares at 
Guddu while he prepares to take an insulin shot. Guddu has 
his stare fixed on the floor. Sweety sobs softly, sitting 
next to an elderly woman. As Bhope injects himself with the 
shot - 
BHOPE

Kaaki.. aata gheun za hilaa..
(Aunty..Now take her away..)
Sweety shrugs the woman’s hand away from her. 
SWEETY

She walks to Guddu and sits by his side.
SWEETY (CONT’D)

tight)
Maiyaa naurya zawal..

Others inside the courtyard hold their breath, expecting the 
worst. Bhope glares at Sweety but smiles all of a sudden. He 
takes Sweety’s hand in his and makes her hit him on his face. 
She resists it but he does it over and over again. 
BHOPE
Kya hua.. ruk kyun rahi hai.. mujhe 
jaan se maarna chahti hai na.. toh 
maar de aaj.. sabke saamne..
He turns to Guddu now.
BHOPE (CONT’D)

BHOPE (CONT’D)
Beti ki tarah paala hai ise maine..

As Guddu struggles to free himself, Bhope suddenly lets go. 
Guddu falls on the ground. 
Bhope isn’t done yet. He darts around like a maniac and 
suddenly picks up a brick. Ganesh  grabs him now and pleads 
with him to drop it. Bhope shrugs him off and charges to a 
nearby window and slams his head into the glass. He looks 
manic with rage as a line of blood streams from his head. 
Bhope stops finally, breathing heavily. He composes himself.

Bhope throws Guddu onto the floor. A beat. Guddu recovers and 
turns around towards Bhope.
GUDDU

Ganesh’s rare sense of humor manages to lighten the tense 
atmosphere a little bit. Bhope chuckles and sits next to 
Guddu on the floor. He gently runs his hand through Guddu’s 
hair.

Before Guddu can finish speaking, Charlie runs towards the 
guitar. Guddu is closer though; he lunges and picks up the 
case before Charlie. He steps back hugging the case tight as 
Charlie runs towards him. 
He head butts Guddu violently and all hell breaks loose. Its 
a wild scuffle as the brothers trade punches and roll about 
on the wet mossy floor. It gradually gets bloody and messy as 
neither of them gives an inch. 
                    92.

Finally Guddu manages to free himself and he tries to get 
away with the guitar when Charlie picks up the gun and points 
it at Guddu. Guddu stops. Charlie wipes blood from his lips 
as he aims intently at his brother. 
GUDDU (CONT’D)
Doosra mauka de rahi hai zindagi 
tujhe.. Is baar sahi rasta mat 
chod..
Guddu starts to limp away from the room as Charlie unlocks 
the safety. His cell phone rings out. Its a call from Tashi. 
He looks back at Guddu. The ringing cell phone pierces the 
silence of the room as Charlie is torn between securing his 
own life versus saving his brother’s.
Guddu walks out of the room. Charlie shuts his eyes as he is 
left alone in the room. The phone stops ringing.

I/E. FLASHBACK
The sequence has a black & white treatment to it - 
EXT. WATCHTOWER - DAY
Two identical twins quietly sit  on the ledge and look 
towards the horizon. Their faces are giddy with anticipation. 
Suddenly, a low siren can be heard as a train appears as a 
speck in the distance. Both the boys scream and hold out 
green flags as the train comes chugging in close. As the loco 
charges past, they clutch each other tightly as the wind 
almost blows them away. 
EXT. WATCHTOWER - DAY
Down below, their father KISHAN, works on the hand lever and 
salutes them smartly. The boys salute back.
INT. RAILWAY QUARTERS - BATHROOM - DAY
Kishan is cleaning up the railway quarters bathroom. He 
suddenly spots a gold plated Rolex watch lying over the soap 
case. He picks it up gingerly and after thinking for a 
second, puts it back where he found it. 
The door behind him is slightly ajar and we can see Kishan’s 
Boss working on his table.
INT. CHARLIE’S YARD - DAY
Guddu is getting ready for school when there is a knock on 
the door. Kishan is shaving and Guddu runs to open the door. 
Its the cops. They notice the watch on Guddu’s clasp. 
                    93.

Kishan stops as he enters the room with the shaving blade in 
his hand. 
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
At the cop station, Kishan sits in a corner and sobs quietly. 
He looks shamed to pieces as Guddu protests his father’s 
innocence. Kishan’s boss sits across the table and looks at 
him disgustedly. The watch is presented at the table.
Charlie stops at the door of the Police Station. He looks 
wide-eyed at his father, not knowing what to make of the 
situation. Guddu is with a Constable in another corner of the 
room. 
EXT. PLATFORM.CONTINUOUS
Charlie silently cries while sitting on a deserted platform. 
Guddu comes running from behind. He cries while speaking.
GUDDU
Woh pa... pa... paanch hazaar, 
ma... ma... maang rahe hain...
Mere pa... paas teen hain...
Charlie turns sharply and wipes his tears
CHARLIE
Kaife..?
GUDDU
Maine je... je... jeb kharche se...

CHARLIE
Kahaan hai ?
GUDDU
Wa... wa... ch... ta... ta...

Guddu nods. Charlie hurriedly gets up and runs while 
speaking.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)

                    94.

EXT. WATCHTOWER - STAIRCASE - DAY
Charlie races up the stairs of the rail shed. 
INT. WATCHTOWER - CONTROL ROOM - DAY
He removes the brick and finds around 2,000 rupees. He runs 
out and starts to sprint towards the cop station. 
EXT. ROAD - MATKA - DAY
Enroute, he sees a group of men playing matka by the 
roadside. The dice is tossed up. Charlie stops.
In a split second, Charlie decides to punt with this money 
and sits down for a session. The dice is tossed up again and 
Charlie wins the first round. 
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
There is a flurry of activity in the Police Station as the 
cops try to break down the bathroom door. Finally, a hefty 
Constable manages to break through. 
INT. POLICE STATION - BATHROOM - DAY
Kishan is slumped on the floor. The shaving blade is washed 
in the river of blood flowing from his wrist.
EXT. POLICE STATION - EVENING
The sun sets in the evening sky. Guddu sits sobbing outside 
the cop station. Their father’s lifeless body lies on the 
corner as a police procedural report is being read out, 
citing the death as a suicide. 
Charlie rushes in through the gates with his pockets bulging 
with money. All colour is drained from his face as he sees 
his father’s body being herded inside an ambulance. Guddu 
stands across the stretcher, his dry eyes piercing Charlie’s. 
Guddu picks up a stone and hurls it at Charlie. As blood 
pours out of Charlie’s forehead - 
JUMP CUT TO:
EXT. CHARLIE’S YARD - MOMENTS LATER
Guddu hobbles along the tracks towards the car but stops. Its 
empty! 
                    95.

He starts to look around and as the camera tracks with him, 
we see Bhope’s goons, lying dead by the door of Charlie’s 
trailer. The hammock swings in the background and Mikhail's 
body is gone. Guddu hears a sound from the back of the 
trailer. 
As he walks over, he is horrified to see a dying Ganesh 
dragging his bloodied torso across the yard. Ganesh turns 
towards him and pleads for help. A silent scream escapes his 
lips as he breathes his last. Guddu’s face turns white as he 
stands frozen at this sight.
He turns around and starts running like a madman. 
EXT. ROAD - DAY
He runs out to the main road and stops for breath as heavy 
traffic passes him by. He looks around bewildered in the 
chaos, not knowing where to go. We stay close to him. 
It starts to drizzle heavily as Guddu makes his choice and 
starts to run again. 
CUT TO:
INT. KANCHENJUNGA VILLA - DAY
Lobo bleeds, lying on a carpet inside Tashi’s villa. Tashi 
sits opposite Lele who is on the phone.
Cajetan and Ragos are in the background, talking animatedly 
in whispers. 
LELE
Charlie ji..! Main Lele bol raha 
hoon.. Inspector lele.. aapke dus 
laakh rupyon ka intezaam ho gaya

He disconnects and looks at Tashi. Lobo moans in pain 
constantly.
LELE
Ab to doctor ko bula dijiye..
(looks at Lobo; snivels)
Aise to bhaiya guzar jayenge..
TASHI
Ek baar aur lagaa..
LELE
Sir..!
                    96.

TASHI
Lagaa..! Aur is baar usne nahi 
uthaya to apna bheja uda lena..
Lele dials the number again as tears roll off his cheeks. 
Tashi puts his pistol in front of Lele.
We go closer to the African duo. Cajetan glares at Ragos.  
CAJETAN
(whispers; in African)
How much longer we gonna wait for 
the stuff?
RAGOS
(in African)
Don’t worry brother.. It’s all 
under control.. 
CAJETAN
He is fucking with us! Can’t you 
see..?
Cajetan loses his cool and bangs his hand hard on the table. 
Tashi looks up towards Cajetan.
RAGOS
(smiles at Tashi; to 
Cajetan)
One more word and I’ll shoot you..
CAJETAN
I have given my blood for the 
diamonds!! You get it..?!
In the background, Lele disconnects the phone. He picks up 
the pistol and shoots Lobo all of a sudden. Boom!
An eerie silence follows the deafening blast from the pistol. 
Ragos and Cajetan look at Tashi, dumbfounded. 
Lobo breathes his last, his gaze fixed on his colleague.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - FIRST FLOOR - LATER
Close shot of the hotel CCTV grabs of Lobo & Lele. Prateek 
leans over the shoulder of his senior officer as he updates 
him on the case. 
In the first picture, they enter the hotel bare handed. In 
the second, they leave the elevator holding the guitar. 
                    97.

As the discussion gets heated, we leave them and see Guddu 
through the window as he dashes breathlessly into the Police 
Headquarters.

Charlie comes face to face with Tashi.
CUT TO:
EXT. BHOPE'S CHAWL - LANE - DAY
Bhope hides behind a wall with some of his men. He signals to 
others across the path, hiding behind another wall, to come 
out. As the men step out, there is a volley of gunfire and 
they scamper back to safety. We see Sweety standing in lane 
outside the house, crying profusely and shooting anyone with 
an LMG who dare cross her path. 
BHOPE
(shouting)
Sweety tu paagal ho gayi hai re..! 
dekh maine to khud aag jalayi hai 
terey bache huye pheron ke liye..! 
Bhauji aate hi honge pagli.. 
bandook phenk de..! 
SWEETY
Tu kutra hai Bhau.. kutra.. mujhe 
pata hai tune kya bola phone pe 
Ganesh ko..!
Bhope is surprised at Sweety’s revelation. As he wonders how, 
he sees the child he gave money to, standing behind a window 
savoring a chocolate. He grits his teeth helplessly.
BHOPE
(softer)
Tujhe galatphehmi hui hai re.. Aai 
kasam mein toh dil se usey apna 
bhauzee maan chuka hoon..
As Bhope speaks, he gestures to his men to shut the house 
gates behind and lock the family members in safety.
                    99.

Sweety fires another round of bullets in reply.

Guddu nods as he gets off the truck.
CUT TO:

Shopkeepers down their shutters as people scatter and get out

the gun towards Bhope who steps back. 
SWEETY
Bhau main maar doongi.. Hat jaa..
BHOPE
Uss bhaiye ke liye tu apne Bhau ko 
maar degi..?
SWEETY
Haan maar doongi.. hat Bhau rasta 
chod..!
As Bhope steps back, he sees his men bringing Guddu in at 
gunpoint. Bhope is surprised to see him alive but gathers his 
wits. He immediately whips his pistol out and jumps on him.   
BHOPE
   (to Sweety)
Ab..khulwa doon iska naariyal..chal 
bandook kar neeche..
Bhope continues to threaten to blow Guddu’s brains out in 
chaste Marathi as a glint of joy passes through Sweety’s 
eyes.

The screaming can be heard on Prateek’s earphones who seems 
slightly confused. As we cut outside on the front road..
EXT. OUTSIDE BHOPE’S CHAWL - CONTINUOUS

CUT TO:
EXT. OUTSIDE BHOPE’S MANSION - CONTINUOUS
The cab caravan come to a stop outside Bhope’s mansion. An 
old man sits on the porch outside. The windows roll down and 
Tashi sticks his head out. 
TASHI
Bhope saheb kute ?
OLD MAN
Chowk Madhe..waat lageli 
hai..yaanchi waat.
Tashi laughs his head off. 
EXT. BHOPE'S CHAWL - SQUARE - CONTINUOUS
The standoff continues and now Guddu tries to reason out 
between the siblings. Prateek is constantly buzzing on 
Guddu’s earpiece as he walks towards Bhope with the guitar.
PRATEEK
Guitar do usey..jaldi..Do you copy 
?..Guddu guitar do usey..
GUDDU
        (to Bhope)
Bhau maal..
Bhope violently pushes Guddu away. The guitar case rolls over 
to the side.
BHOPE
Bhaad mein gaya maal.. bandook 
neeche rakhne bol use..!
Guddu turns to Sweety desperately.
GUDDU
Sweety main sahi salamat hoon na. 
Please..ab bandook neeche kar lo.. 
please
                    101.

Sweety is unsure whether to let go of her advantage when 
Tashi emerges from behind her with a few of his men. Bhope 
and Guddu react on these new visitors.
Sweety turns and starts firing on instinct. Tashi and his men 
scramble for safety as the bullets zip past their legs. They 
somehow duck and run back into the lane. 
In the meantime, Bhope manages to tiptoe behind her back. 
Sweety turns around in a flash. Their eyes lock into each 
other as she clamps the gun straight into his chest. A silent 
beat. 
As if in a trance, her fingers involuntarily pull the 
trigger. But the bullets are over and the gun doesn’t fire. 
Bhope stands frozen in his place. He can’t believe his eyes. 
A beat.
Suddenly the trance is broken and Bhope slaps Sweety hard. As 
Guddu screams and tries to intervene, Bhope’s men beat him 
too.
Tashi and his men have now recovered and stand across and 
watch all this action. After a while, Bhope composes himself 
and turns towards Tashi and gang.
BHOPE
Kaun hai re tu ?
Tashi smiles and lifts the hem of his shirt. A shiny gun 
sits, tucked into his trousers.
TASHI
Bhope..topein hamaare paas bhi 
hain.. Badi badi..par khamaakhan 
war kyon ladein.. I am not 
America..
BHOPE
But this is Maharashtra..Tu hai 
kaun ?
TASHI
Me.. I am Tashi the great..
Tashi smiles and turns towards his entourage. We see Cajetan 
and Ragos stream in, along with his other men.
TASHI (CONT’D)
Ho..meet my allies.. Mr. Angola and 
Mr.Portugal 
Afghani follows closely, holding a bloodied Charlie by the 
collar. 
                    102.

TASHI (CONT’D)
   (continues)
..and last but not the least.. 
Charlie Boy
Guddu,who is sprawled on the floor,is surprised to see 
Charlie’s state. Charlie stares back at him blankly. 
Bhope signals his men to take the guitar inside his house. 
Tashi’s men take positions quickly as Bhope’s men gather 
themselves and get their weapons out. An uneasy calm pervades 
in the air.
CUT TO:
I/E. OUTSIDE BHOPE'S CHAWL - TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
The mobile office inside the truck has gone into a tizzy. The 
hotlines buzz continuously. The commandoes clock their guns 
and ready themselves for action. Prateek wears his bullet 
proof vest and instructs his junior excitedly.

Prateek and the cops move stealthily in the winding galis of

Guddu on the wireless to not panic and that they’ll be there 
soon.
EXT. BHOPE'S CHAWL - SQUARE - COURTYARD - DAY
Bhope and Tashi now sit across a makeshift table in the 
middle of the courtyard and talk business. Their men stand 
nearby and keep stock.
TASHI
Aapke ghar mein Murphy ka calendar

BHOPE
Kya...?
                    103.

TASHI
Nahi.. Aapki shakal uss bachhe

Bhope looks back poker faced.
TASHI (CONT’D)
Aur akal bhi...
Tashi laughs aloud as Bhope’s face goes grim. He hardens his 
grip on the gun.
BHOPE
Ungli..? meri ungali dab gayi toh 
teri akal yahaan zameen pe aa 
jaayegi... samjha... 
Tashi senses some movement on the terraces. His eyes dart 
sharply but there’s no one. He turns to Bhope.
TASHI
Maal daboch toh liya bhau... par 
bechoge kahaan...? Kise...? 
Kaise...? Ghoom phir ke hamaare 
yahan hi aayega vo guitar...
Batao kitne ka cheque kaatoon

Bhope smiles sarcastically and leans forward.
BHOPE
Dus karod.. cash
Tashi again senses some movement on the terraces. He suddenly 
notices the blue tooth fixed on Guddu’s ear which has come 
off slightly. He lunges at Guddu with the gun. Almost 
immediately, Prateek’s voice is heard on the megaphone.
EXT. BHOPE’S CHAWL - TERRACES- LATER
The team of commandos led by Prateek have now taken positions 
over the terraces of the neighboring houses. Prateek’s voice 
comes on loud and clear above the din.
                 PRATEEK

This is the Anti Narcotics Cell of

EXT. BHOPE'S CHAWL - SQUARE - COURTYARD - DAY
Down in the courtyard, guns are immediately drawn out between 
Tashi and Bhope’s men. There is utter chaos as everybody 
tries to get out of the snipers’ range.  Charlie takes 
advantage of this diversion and stealthily advances towards 
the house where the guitar case was taken.
INT. GUITAR HOUSE-CONTINUOUS
A violent fist fight begins between Charlie and Bhope’s men. 
CUT TO:
EXT. BHOPE'S CHAWL - SQUARE - COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS
Tashi now has Guddu at gunpoint as he yells out in the

PRATEEK

Usey kuch bhi hua to koi nahi

Suddenly Bhope pipes up from the background. 
BHOPE
Chara hai saheb... neeche aao na.. 
Aaram se baith ke baat karte

33, 33, 33..
Prateek’s subordinate looks at him, whose face has gone quiet 
by now. Bhope raises the stakes.
BHOPE (CONT’D)
Chalo.. 50, 25, 25..
We cut on a wide. There is an uneasy silence in the air. 
Ragos and Cajetan can’t believe their ears. They were trying 
to pawn their own stash in front of them.  Bhope yells again.
BHOPE (CONT’D)
Ab 60, 20, 20 last nahi to maar do

Suddenly Charlie’s voice booms out loud.
                    105.

CHARLIE
Ae..Kifi ne bhi goli chalayi toh

Everyone turns in the direction of the voice to see Charlie 
holding the guitar case over the fire. He opens the case and 
everyone can see the coke packs clearly. Nobody speaks for a 
while.

Guddu looks at Sweety with concern yet not totally sure.As 
Guddu and Sweety start to leave reluctantly...
EXT. BHOPE'S CHAWL - SQUARE - COURTYARD - DAY
A silent shot of a gangster, who was guarding the terrace, 
plunging down. As he lands in the middle of the courtyard 
with a loud thud, everyone is stunned. 
Suddenly, a pole comes crashing through and Mujib and Shumon 
burst in in an open jeep, shooting with their AK 56 rifles. 
Mikhail’s lifeless body lies looped over the front seat. 
Tears brim over in the brothers’s eyes.
Charlie, who still holds the guitar case over the fire, 
notices Mikhail’s dead body. His eyes simmer over with rage. 
He screams out like a wild animal and holds up the guitar 
case triumphantly. Mujib and Charlie exchange a tearful look.
                    106.

In a flash,Charlie drops the guitar case into the fire. As 
the case comes tumbling, the white powder explodes in the 
air. The snowfall dazzles in the early evening light. 
Visibility turns poor and in the confusion that follows, 
everyone scatters helter-skelter. 
INT. BHOPE’S CHAWL - NEIGHBOR HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Beads of sweat break out on the police snipers as they try to 
figure out who to aim at. The walkie-talkies buzz with 
Prateek’s instructions - ‘Hold your fire!’ 
The coke fumes start to fill the air as Mujib and Shumon 
start shooting indiscriminately. As bullets start whizzing, 
the ledge gives way and Charlie comes toppling down. Charlie 
coughs and spits as he lands on the road.
EXT. BHOPE’S CHAWL - COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS
The coke has now risen, creating a fog. Through the fog and 
obscured bodies falling - we see
- Sweety caught in a crossfire between Mujib Shumon and 
Bhope’s men. She covers her head with her hands and slumps on 
the ground, screaming. 
Suddenly, a hand comes from behind and covers her mouth . She 
is pulled inside an abandoned house. As she turns around,she 
notices its Charlie ! As he quietly asks her to hush,Sweety 
goes delirious and pleads with him for Guddu’s life. Charlie 
locks her inside and goes out looking for his brother.
EXT. BHOPE’S CHAWL - COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS
-  In one of the alleys, Bhope and Afghani come face to face  
with guns drawn. They share a beat. 
As we jump cut, we see Afghani and Bhope on a scooter, 
driving through all the smoke and gunfire. Bhope is 
instructing Afghani on exit routes out of the chawl and the 
way to the highway.
AFGHANI
Ae seedhe baith na tu..
BHOPE
Arre.. Mujhe peeche se maar diya 
toh
AFGHANI
Agar Aage se koi  maarega toh, gun 
de..
BHOPE
Arre.. Tu chalayega kaise?
                    107.

AFGHANI

AFGHANI
Arre left mein hai
BHOPE
Arre main ulta baitha hoon na yaar
AFGHANI

BHOPE

yaar
Suddenly, Shumon appears in their path. As Shumon shoots in 
their direction, Bhope ducks and Afghani is shot to pieces. 
The scooter goes and hits a pole. Afghani’s corpse lands on 
Bhope’s torso as both come crashing down. As Shumon comes 
closer to them, Bhope pretends to play dead. As Shumon kicks 
Afghani’s body over,Bhope stealthily draws his gun out from 
under and shoots him point blank.
Bhope now drags the half dead Afghani as cover and limps his 
way out of the narrow alley.
EXT. BHOPE’S CHAWL - COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS
- In another alley, Lele comes face to face with Tashi. Lele 
puts his gun on Tashi. His eyes look manic with revenge as he 
clocks the gun. Suddenly Tashi distracts him by pointing at 
some imaginary cops behind.
By the time, Lele turns around, Tashi has vanished through 
all the smoke. Lele runs in his direction. The chase is on. 
EXT. BHOPE’S CHAWL - ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS
The snipers on the rooftops have trained their scopes on Lele 
and Tashi as they shoot their way through the alleys. The 
snipers radio Prateek that they have two suspects in their 
view and that one of them looks like Inspector Lele. Prateek 
instructs them sternly that Inspector Lele is off duty and 
that they should take down whoever looks like a suspect.
                    108.

EXT. BHOPE’S CHAWL - COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS
- As Tashi turns a corner, there is a quick burst of gunfire 
and Lele slumps to the ground. Tashi panics and jumps over a 
neighboring wall as bullets thud into the cement near him.
EXT. BHOPE’S CHAWL - COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS
-  As Tashi climbs up a staircase,Cajetan jumps him from the 
back and stabs him. Tashi recovers and shoots him back with a 
concealed handgun. As he drags himself up, he sees something 
glinting in Cajetan’s clenched fist. 
No sooner has Tashi taken a few steps towards the glint, 
Ragos comes charging in from the distance. Tashi nonchalantly 
turns round and shoots him point blank. He pulls open 
Cajetan’s fist and sees the sparkling twin diamonds. A single 
teardrop slides out of Cajetan’s left eye as his life ebbs 
out slowly. 
EXT. BHOPE’S CHAWL - COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS
- Tashi grabs the diamonds and limps down the staircase but 
only finds Mujib with his AK 56 rifle. They shoot each other.

- Prateek and his men now burst into the compound. Guddu is 
part of the cop party as he tries to locate Sweety 
frantically. 
The compound is littered with bodies. Bhope still lies on the 
floor, pretending to play dead. Prateek spots his heaving 
stomach as he tries to crawl away on the floor. He stumbles 
over to him and grabs him up by the collar. He greets him 
with a ‘Jai Maharashtra’. Bhope looks numbed by all the blood 
and coke strewn around him. As Prateek tries to shake him out 
of his stupor, Bhope notices Sweety standing at the back with 
some female cops. As the cops start to lead him away, he 
walks by Sweety in a daze.    
The rest is blurred in the sound and fury of a white fog.
I/E. BHOPE’S COURTYARD - DIFFERENT AREA - LATER
In another part of the courtyard, a coughing Charlie wakes up 
from the dead. He tries to crawl his way to a safe corner. As 
he drags his body along, he suddenly spots something glinting 
in Tashi’s clenched fist. We stay on his face as he lies 
completely still, his eyes fixed in the direction of the 
glow. There is a sound of thunderclap on his impassive face. 
The moment is prolonged - 
                    109.

CHARLIE (V.O.)
Zindagi mein hamaari vaat iffe nahi 
lagti ki hum kaunsa raasta chunte 
hain..
As he picks himself up in an effort to stand, Thwack! Thwack! 
A couple of bullets come thudding in from the back and catch 
him in the rib cage. A blot of fresh red blood drenches 
Charlie’s shirt in seconds. As he looks back over his 
shoulder, he sees a dying Ragos flip over, his gun still 
pointed at Tashi. Charlie stares at his own blood 
incredulously as he brings out his smeared hand. He comes 
crashing down in high speed and falls next to Tashi’s body.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
Vaat lagti hai iffe ki hum kaun sa 
raasta chodte hain..
As he is passing out, he sees a blurred Sweety and Prateek 
hunched over him, trying to stir him awake.

INT. NURSING HOME - CORRIDOR - DAY
Close shot of a nurse’s slender legs as it goes clippety-clop 
down the long hospital corridor. As she marches into the 
theatre, the operating bulb comes on. 
INT. NURSING HOME - OPERATION THEATRE - CONTINUOUS
Close shot of a syringe being prepared by the Anesthetist. 
One by one, the doctors and attendants finish donning their 
gloves and face masks. A couple of nurses get the suction 
tubes ready.
CUT TO:
INT. NURSING HOME - CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
A pensive looking Guddu lurks outside the OT. He paces up and 
down the corridor, biting his nails. Suddenly the doors open 
and the doctor comes out. He looks grim faced at first and 
then warmly pats Guddu on the back.   
‘Twins!’ He announces. The friends break into a whoopee and 
hugs are exchanged all around. The doctor offers to take 
Guddu in. Guddu starts to dial a number as he walks in 
excitedly.
                    110.

INT. NURSING HOME - MATERNITY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Sweety wakes from her slumber, she sees Guddu smiling 
beautifully at her. As her gaze lowers, she sees both her 
angels, one on each arm. Guddu shifts as he tries hard to 
balance their positions. The couple’s eyes run over with 
emotions.
CUT TO:
EXT. RACE COURSE - BETTING WINDOW - DAY
Guddu sums up the happy news on the phone. On the other end, 
the screen wipes in to see Charlie dressed in a dapper suit, 
talking the talk at the race course. His arm is now tied in a 
sling. As he turns into camera, we realize Charlie sits at 
his spanking new betting window. As he hears out the excited 
Guddu on the phone
CHARLIE
Maine kaha tha faale.. judva 
honge.. Mere faath farth lagayega 
toh haarega hamefa... kifpe gaye 
hain dono...?
He listens for a while.
CHARLIE (CONT’D)
How (f)sweet...! Aata hoon aata 
hoon... laft rafe clofe hone waali 
hai, ufke baad... fi yu...!
he casually remarks that he’d always told him so. Now he owes 
him a grand, 500 for each niece. Guddu refutes him and a 
fresh argument begins. As he continues ribbing Guddu, Charlie 
gestures two at his book keeper and closes the bids for the 
day’s races. 
The camera tilts down from the hoarding - ’Kismet & Bros.’ We 
catch Charlie’s back as he gets up and waltzes through the 
betting area. Faints strains of the argument can be still 
heard. 
EXT. RACE COURSE - PRIVATE BOX?? - DAY
People around give him the right of the way as he glides 
fashionably into his private box. As he enters, Charlie 
disconnects the phone. 
The same pretty girl, who had appeared in the first dream, 
puts down her binoculars and turns around. The race has 
begun. She excitedly pulls him in and starts to cheer their 
favourite. As they clasp hands firmly, Charlie looks happy 
but a tad thoughtful. Unmindfully, he starts to caress the 
rock on her finger. 
                    111.

As the camera goes closer, it’s revealed to be a solitary 
diamond from the original set of twin diamonds! On Charlie’s 
expression - 
FADE TO BLACK.
END TITLES ROLL OVER THE KAMINEY THEME SONG.
