On the vaporized surface of a glass, a finger makes a horoscope, 
while on the soundtrack we hear the laughter of a cop (Inspector 
Purohit) and a gangster (Saadiq Chikna), the sound of heavy 
rains, and urgent summons on the radio of the police van.

Sonuvabitch screwed up my whole night… everytime 
I’d cock the gun, he’d start screaming… shooting him 
in the back was out of the question… asked him to run 
but the bugger fell on my knees grovelling… it’s damn 
tough to shoot a guy who’s shitting fear like that…

SONG 1 (Tu mere ru baru hai): Sufi song starts at dargah. The 
singer is singing in the praise of the Almighty, but the impact 
is implying Maqbool’s feelings for Nimmi, and Guddu’s for

Sameera do so simultaneously. Maqbool catches this. Nimmi 
smiles. Song ends as their car leaves back for the town.

Maqbool slowly walks across the lawn. Flashes of Abbaji’s 
lovemaking with Nimmi jostle with his own memories of her. 
The music grows to a fever pitch and suddenly comes to a

Usman is drugged out. Maqbool steals Usman’s pistol and sneaks 
into the room.

INT. /NIGHT/ABBA JI’S ROOM (FARMHOUSE) 
Nimmi is wide awake. Maqbool stands over the bed. They look 
at Abbaji, who is in deep slumber. A moment of decision as 
they lock eyes. Maqbool removes the silencer and fixes it over 

86
Usman’s pistol. He tears his eyes away as he pulls the trigger. 
Blood splashes on Nimmi’s face as the bullet pierces through 
Abbaji’s heart. A beat. Suddenly, Abbaji’s eyes open and he 
clambers out of bed. Maqbool and Nimmi are paralysed with 
fear. Abbaji tries to get up but crumples into a heap on the floor, 
lifeless.

the gun in the air and shoots.

Outside Abbaji’s room, the drugged Usman wakes up with a 
start. Blindly, on instinct, he picks up the gun in his lap and 
blunders into the room.

Inside the room, Nimmi is waiting calmly with the gun pointed at 
the door. Usman looks confused. Nimmi shoots him in the chest.

There is a furore in the house as people start rushing towards

announcing their arrival. The gunmen run outside the house 
and take position. Maqbool’s men get off the cars and do the 
same. It’s a Mexican stand-off. Maqbool coolly gets down from 
his sedan and walks towards the gate. He takes out his gun and 
drops it to the ground. He asks his men to wait outside.

We’re still with you… Miyan…
He looks at the sky and takes a deep breath.

Maqbool’s car leaves. A jeeps stops, Pandit jumps out of it and 
runs to Purohit in anger.

EXT. /INT. /NIGHT/FARMHOUSE 
Maqbool and Nimmi arrive at the farmhouse; it is deserted 
except for a few guards standing around in the shadows. 
Maqbool and Nimmi enter through the door. She winces in pain 
as Maqbool struggles to carry her. It is dark. Suddenly music can 
be heard in the main hall. As Maqbool watches transfixed, a light 
comes on and we see the hall decorated with lights and flowers, 
filled with happy people, dancing and singing. We see Abbaji, 
dancing. Kaka, Usman and the Nanny give him company. Kaka 
cracks a low joke and laughs. 
Maqbool shakes himself out of the reverie. Suddenly the hall is 
dark again.

INT. /NIGHT/FARMHOUSE ROOM 
Maqbool places Nimmi on the bed, and starts putting money, 
guns and bullets in a leather bag. He takes out two passports, 
checks them. Nimmi opens her eyes. 
NIMMI

This room has not been cleaned in ages… 
Maqbool looks at her, goes close and kisses her on her forehead. 
Nimmi gets up with a jerk. 
NIMMI

See… the walls are still stained with blood. How will it 
all come off?

Maqbool turns; the walls are absolutely clean.
MAQBOOL

She turns him to the same site.
NIMMI

There… can’t you see?
We see the wall full of the patches of black blood, from her 
point of view. Suddenly she looks at the bedsheet. It also has 
dry blood on it. 
NIMMI

Oh God… even the sheets have not been changed…
She jumps off the bed and goes to the bathroom shouting aloud, 
while Maqbool looks at her in complete shock.

She comes out carrying a bucket of water. He tries stopping her 
but she screams and pushes him away.

The stench of blood is everywhere… I have to clean up. 
I won’t be able to sleep otherwise. 
She starts washing the room. He loses the grip of the passports in 
his hand. They fall on the floor. He sits down with the support 
of a wall and watches her in helplessness. After a while she gets 
irritated, scratching a patch of the wall, and throws the cloth 
away and cries out. She comes and sits next to Maqbool. 
NIMMI

Maqbool keeps quiet.

FADE IN.
It’s morning. Devsare and his men enter the farmhouse. They 
creep up stealthily, surrounding the whole place. Just then, 
Pandit and Purohit’s jeep drives up.

Devsare just pushes them away and pulls his gun on them.
DEVSARE
I said shut up and get lost from here… I said move… 
come on quick… fast.
Pandit and Purohit hurriedly sit in the jeep and drive away.
Cut to Maqbool’s room. Maqbool wakes up from all the 
commotion. Nimmi still lies in his lap. He gets up and looks at 
the men in white, crawling like ants. Maqbool walks back to the 
bed, takes a sheet and covers Nimmi. We realize she is dead. He 
hugs her one last time. 
SC. 74B 
INT. /DAY/FARMHOUSE/VARIOUS
Devsare and his men comb the house thoroughly. The whole 
place is deserted. From the roof, he catches a glimpse of a police 
jeep pulling away in the distance.

Damn it…

Pandit and Purohit stop the jeep outside the hospital. Pandit 
whispers, while looking out.

INT. /DAY HOSPITAL 
Maqbool steals into the hospital. He keeps a low profile, milling 
with the crowd. Just as he comes in, he sees Guddu entering the 
elevator. He goes for his gun but the doors shut. Maqbool runs 
up the stairs, gun in hand. Finally, he reaches his floor. Guddu 
is walking down the corridor. Maqbool follows with his gun.
When he reaches the ward, he looks in through the glass window. 
The doctor takes the child from the incubator and hands it to 
Sameera. She takes the child in her arms and looks up at Guddu. 
Guddu takes the child and kisses his forehead. Maqbool staggers, 
and we see the fight has gone out of him. His eyes brim over. He 
sees his son, in the arms of his loving guardians. He drops his 
gun and walks out in a daze.

SC. 76 
EXT /DAY /HOSPITAL 
Maqbool walks out of the hospital. He brushes past Boti at 
the entrance, who takes a moment to realize who he is. He 
stops, shocked. He draws his gun, in full view. People stop and 
stare, transfixed; others run off in horror. Boti keeps shouting 
for Maqbool to turn and look at him, but Maqbool carries on 
walking, oblivious to him. Finally, Boti shoots. 
Maqbool collapses on to the cold cement. As he lies dying, his 
eyes close gradually, shutting out the harsh sun. Life’s fitful fever 
has come to an end.
The End
