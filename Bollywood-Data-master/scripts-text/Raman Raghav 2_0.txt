jo baap apone bete ko deta 
hai..  
Raghavan looks at Ramanna.

jo maa apni beti ko deti

Tune Smrutika ko kyon maara? 
RAMANNA 
Simmy.. apun toh unko bas 
dekhta tha.. wo kya hai na 
sahab ki apun bahut nashe me 
tha.. apun ko ek ladki 
chahiye the.. ab ladki toh 
sabko chahiye hoti hai naa.. 
aurat ke chakkar mein Ramayan 
aur Mahabharat ho gaya..

Raavan jaisa bramhan villain 
ho gaya.. aurat ke chakkar 
mein usne Pushpak vimaan 
banaya batao.. socho aurat na 
hoti toh aaj hawai jahaaj na 
hota.. apan toh jab bhi hawai 
jahaz ko dekhta hai na toh 
apne aap se bolta hai.. Ae 
Ramanna..

Aaj phir uda koi Ravan kisi 
Sita ke sath.. isko zameen pe

apun ginti karta hai.. ek din

hawai jahaz, utne Ravan, utni 
Sita, utne Ram..

Lekin problem ye thi ki usko

Simmy ne darwaaza khola..  
Raghavan stares at Ramanna.  
 
RAMANNA (CONT'D) 
usko baaju me hata ke main 
seedha kamre me gaya usko le

usme muh mein zor se thappad 
maara aise.. apun ne bahut 
nasha kiya hua tha.. apun ka

collar..  
RAGHAVAN 
(breaths heavily) 
 
tujhe chahiye kya? 
RAMANNA 
kuchh nahi.. apun toh bas 
aatm-samarpan karne ke liye 
aaya tha.. 
RAGHAVAN 
Kyon.. 
RAMANNA 
Mera maza mil gaya mere ko.. 
aapko kis cheez me maza milta 
hai.. nashe mein!.. apne 
jhole mein poora packet hai 
powder ka.. us Simmy ke 

 
107 
drawer me rakh chhoda tha 
na.. 
RAGHAVAN 
ae..ae.. tujhe chahiye kya.. 
kyon kar raha hai ye sab?.. 
game kya hai tera.. tu aaya 
kyon hai yahan? 
RAMANNA 
Aapki aankh mein aankh 
daalne..

bade police wale ki aankh 
mein aankh daal ke baat karne 
ka maza hi zabardast hota 
hai..  
Raghavan leaves his collar and sits next to him. he 
is tensed. Ramanna looks at him. 
RAMANNA 
Jab apun chhota tha.. tabhi 
Raman-Raghav ka kahani suna.. 
Crime karne ka apna alag maza 
hota hai.. har aadmi kisi na 
kisi ko maarna chahta hai aur 
sabko mauka milta hai.. ye 
danga-fasaad hota hai na.. 
kitna log bheed mein apna 
bhadaas nikaalta hai.. udhar 
syria mein.. duniya bhar se 
log chal ke jaata hai apne 
andar ke jaanwar ko hawa dene 
ke liye.. apun toh akela 
nanga khada hoke maarta hai.. 
bina jhijhke, sochta bhi nahi 
hai.. aur baad mein bura bhi 
nahi lagta.. aaj tak ek aadmi 

 
108 
aurat ya bachhe ko apun ne 
galti se nahi maara, ye 
guarantee hai apun ka.. na 
vardi ki aad me maara.. na 
dharam ke peechhe chhup ke 
maara.. na insaniyat ka 
labaada odh ke maara.. maara 
isiliye kyonki maarna tha 
jaise apun khana khate hain.. 
hagta hai.. waise hi maarta 
hai.. ekdum naturally.. 
Raghavan looks at him. 
 
RAGHAVAN 
Smrutika ko tune maara? 
RAMANNA 
Toh kya aapne maara? main 
Sindhi Dalwai urf Ramanna ki 
jabaan hai.. Simmy ka ilzaam 
mere upar hai.. lekin phir 
bhi ek cheez hai jo sab kuchh 
bigaad sakti hai.. aur wo hai 
Ankita.. us raat kya hua, 
Ankita ko sab kuchh pata 
hai.. aur Ankita ki kismat 
nahi hai ki wo galti se 
mare..  
RAGHAVAN 
us se tujhe kya milega? 
RAMANNA 
Santushti.. apan ka kahani 
toh khatam.. Raman ko uska 
Raghav mil gaya.. bas 
RAGHAVAN 
main kyon? 

 
109 
RAMANNA 
Hmm ? 
RAGHAVAN 
Main hi kyon? 
RAMANNA 
Ye toh upar se likhwa ke le 
ke aaye hain hum dono.. is 
duniya mein har aadmi ka koi 
na koi hai.. jo use poora 
karta hai.. Galti toh aadmi 
ye kar ke sochta hai ki use 
poora karne wali koi aurat 
hogi.. meri kismat achhi thi 
ya aapki kharaab.. jab apun 
ne pahla aadmi maara.. aap 
apun ko dikhe the..

Tabhi se pahli nazar mein 
apun ko pyaar ho gaya tha aap 
se ki ye aadmi hai jo apun ko 
mukti dega.. aur aap apni 
mukti aurat me dhoondh rahe 
the.. tab se apun intezaar 
kar raha tha.. bina tapasya 
ke koi sampoorna nahi hota.. 
ye sabar hi hai jo aapko 
aapke jodi-daar se milata 
hai.. baaki sabka toh bas 
aana-jaana hota hai 
timepass.. meri zimmedari ab 
aapke upar hai.. aage kahani 
toh aapka hai bas.. ek 
cigarette milega?
