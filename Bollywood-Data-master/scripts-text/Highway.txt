Highway  
Script 
 
Opening  
 
The highway seen from the front seat of a moving Tempo Traveler. 
Sound of the engine, passing vehicles, trees. A song in a girl’s voice. Not a 
singer, singing to herself. Uncertain lyrics, sounds like a lullaby – ‘Don’t cry baby… 
Don’t worry, I am with you. When you wake up in the morning, the sun will be 
shining, the birds will be singing. And everything will be all right.’ 
The road keeps changing. From plain to hills, from forest to desert. 
Titles of the film appear.  
Fade-out.

Home Video  
 
Wedding preparations in a rich city bungalow. Guests, clothes, jewellery, 
decorated gifts. All bright. The video must have been shot by a kid in the house. We 
see the bride to be – wishing people, smiling, bright, respectful. Dholki, geet, 
sherbet...

Tripathy House 
 
A large bungalow in a premium Delhi colony.  
Back of the house – a shadow passes a window, a door opens and a figure 
steals out, then makes it’s way across the lawn.  
 
Key is put to a lock and turned. The small corner gate opens. The figure, 
wrapped in a shawl, sneaks out, then walks down the lane.  
 
The figure hurries up the pavement, runs across the street, removing the shawl 
cover. It is the bride to be. Her name is Veera. She comes to a waiting car and sits in 
excitement. A man named Vinay has come to pick her up.  
Vinay  
Itni kya urgency thi yaar...?  
Veera  
(simultaneously) Let’s go let’s go let’s go... 
Vinay 
Zindagi saath bitaani hai humein, abhi ye log keh rahe hain kuch din 
mat milo to ruk jaate hai na...?  
Veera 
Chalo na... 
Vinay 
Veera, I think tum vaapas chali jao. Abhi tak kisi ne dekha nahin hai 
humein... 
Veera 
Vinay yaar I want to breathe... Ye rasam-rivaaj aur aaiye ji namaste 
ji... ghaghra aur jhumka aur nathni... please chalo yahan se... Thodi der 
is ghar se door rehte hain, khule mein. Sirf ek ghante ke liye... 
Vinay  
Ek ghante ke liye...? 
Veera  
Gaadi to start karo... 
Vinay

Veera  
Achcha chalo to...  
Vinay shakes his head, starts the car.  
Vinay

The car is driving on a Delhi street.

Vinay  
Paanch minute bache hain... 
Veera 
Arey...? Abhi time start nahin hua hai. Pehle in bright lights se to 
nikalte hain, khule mein jaate hain kaheen... Highway chalein?  
Vinay 
Bina security ke? 
Veera 
Bus highway ko touch kar ke aa jayenge, theek hai? Promise... 
Vinay  
Dekho ye bilkul... 
Veera

Veera  
Ahhh… it’s working… Dimagh ke saare knots khul rahe hain... 
Vinay  
Good, vaapas chalte hain 
Veera  
(quickly) Thode aur khulne hain. Little more, okay...?

Haan to little more...

Highway Petrol Station 
 
The car drives into a petrol station. The lights are dim and no one is seen at the 
pumps.  
 
Inside the car, Vinay is looking around at the pumps.  
Vinay  
Band to nahin ho gaya? 
 
He honks. Veera opens the door and gets out of the car.  
Vinay  
Veera sit... Veera...  
Veera is already out, he looks at her, annoyed. She comes in front of the car 
and opens her arms, takes a deep breath.  
Veera  
See... Hawa kitni alag hai yahan. Kitni Fresh... 
Vinay  
Veera just come back... 
Veera 
Sheher mein to bechaini hoti hai saans lene mein... Aisa kyon nahin ho 
sakta...? 
Vinay  
Agar tumhaara drama khatam ho gaya hai to vaapas aa jao 
Veera  
Tum baahar aao na... Ek second ke liye...  
Vinay  
Veera main keh raha hoon... 
Veera  
Just for one second... 
Suddenly, a gun shot is heard. Then a loud clang of a metal and desperate 
screaming – Peeche dekh peeche se aa ro ae... Maar... Ae ruk.... Ya pakad, likad... 
etc. 
Veera turns in shock towards the petrol pump cabin.   
Some people scamper out of the cabin, a few of them pointing guns. Two 
people in a scuffle with a gunman. Oye Ravi... Chup teri... Vilaas... Vaeen pado reh... 
Chal bhaag aa rein peeche... Tu gaadi s-tart kar... Ruk ja ke raoon, khada reh...  
The men rush out. Veera is in their way. Faces of the men are covered with 
scarfs, blankets. She is transfixed as they cross close to her. One of them runs up to 
her, grabs her, twists her hand behind her and screams out to the cabin –  
Mahabir 
Ruk saala... Ruk... Ruk... 
Veera screams in pain. Something hot hits her temple. It is a gun.  
 
 

 
Mahabir 
Sagle khade raho vaheen... 
Two guards have rushed in with guns, but now look tentatively in Veera’s 
direction. One of them moves up. 
Mahabir 
Teri... 
The man holding Veera fires a shot towards the cabin. A glass shatters. Those 
men brace. The gun is brought back to Veera’s temple. Veera screams.  
Mahabir 
Agli idhar chalegi... Pher na boloonga... (screams at his men) Arey kah 
wa jeep ko? 
Someone is trying to start a jeep kept on the other side. It’s not starting. The 
others are waiting.  
Man 2  
Check na kee pehle...? Hain...?  
Man 3  
Ya laaya kona...? 
Veera feels her arm is going to come off the socket, it is being pulled so hard. 
She screams again. The man holding her hisses in reaction and she is banged on the 
bonnet of Vinay’s car. The gun is on her temple. She looks at Vinay. Vinay has not 
moved. Veera is looking at Vinay.  
Veera  
(screams) Vinay... 
She whimpers in pain.  
Vinay is staring. Sounds of the jeep being started, men abusing. 
Veera  
(screams again) Vinay.... 
Vinay   
(suddenly) Maine kaha tha na...? Maine kaha tha...  
Man 2  
(OC) Ya gaddi pakad... 
Vinay  
(continues) Ab khush? 
Just then someone opens his door and pulls him out. Punches and kicks are 
landed roughly on him. One of the men sits in the driver’s seat, the others get into the 
car. 
Mahabir 
Baitho sagle bheetar... (to the cabin) Khabardaar...   
Then Veera is lifted from the bonnet and pushed towards the rear of the car. 
She is screaming in pain. She is pushed inside the car.  
Mahabir 
Thaam yaae... 
Two others get in the rear after Veera. 
 

 
Mahabir 
(calling out, OC) Peeche aayo koi to goli chal jaagi...  
Veera is sitting squashed in the darkness, unable to fully comprehend what is 
really happening. The man holds the gun to her forehead from the front seat.  
Mahabir 
(calling out, OC) Dekh roun main...  
Man 2  
Chal nikal, nikal... 
Mahabir 
Tonk e phaun laga... 
The car suddenly takes off amidst more threats and abuses. Veera panics, but 
is pulled back. Unbearable pain in her arms. Someone passes a phone to the man in 
front. Someone squeezes Veera in the darkness, she grimaces. 
Mahabir 
(turns back) Ae... (into phone) Tere paas gaudi ae...? Kauhan hai tu? 
 
Veera is choking, yelping. She can barely see anything inside the car. She 
can’t follow the brisk, tense dialect that the men are speaking in – 
Driver  
Jaana kahaun ae...? 
Mahabir 
(into phone) Mangad ke peeche waalo rasto dekh ro ae... (to the driver) 
Seedho chal batata oon  
Man 3 
Main bataoon...  
Mahabir 
(into phone) Tonk vaaye raaste par paahad ke peeche aa ja khtettan

Highway, Path, Crops 
 
The car is seen turning away from the highway into a path leading to crops. 
The car comes to a stop between the crops.  
Veera is transfixed as the men rush out of the car. She sits there, heaving, 
yelping like a dog. She looks up.  
The men are running away, have reached a turn in the crops. A slight relief 
begins to come to her. But she sees that the men stop. One of them points in her 
direction and another begins to run towards her. She stiffens. He is coming back, her 
breath rises again. She grabs her phone from the front dashboard, makes to call. Then 
she makes to shut the door, the man holds the door and begins to pull roughly, 
abusing her. He opens the door, grabs her. Another man comes from behind and 
pushes her out.  
She is brought out of the car, one of the men holds her mouth. Another picks 
up the phone, they rush her to the others at the turn of the crops.  
The man waiting speaks – 
Mahabir 
(OC) Chhod... 
The two leave her. Veera stares at this man. This is Mahabir Bhaati. He looks 
at her, then pulls at the hair behind her head. She screams, he stuffs cloth into her 
mouth, the others tie her mouth with a scarf.  
Then Mahabir lowers her head, still holding the hair above her nape and turns 
her into the path between the crops. Some torches are on. Veera is rushed down the 
path faster than she can manage. She stumbles occasionally, falls, is pulled up by the 
hair and the rush through the path continues.

Mud Path 
 
A Marshall jeep is parked in the darkness. Someone is standing there, shining 
his phone as indication.  
Mahabir and the others emerge from the crops. Veera is faintly by now. The 
man near the jeep calls out -   
Tonk  
Aa jao aa jao... Sagle o...? 
Mahabir 
Haan...  
Tonk  
Yu koun ae...? 
Mahabir 
Peeche ke darwajje khol. Goru baith... Daalo yaaye bhitter... 
Veera looks up. The back door of the jeep opens.  She is now going to be 
lifted into the rear of the jeep.  
Another man holds her to take her in. Veera suddenly grunts and shrieks and 
puts up a wild, superhuman struggle to break free. The others grab her, try to restrain 
her. Veera pushes desperately. If she does not manage to get away now, if she is 
hoisted into that darkness, her life as she knows it is over. Veera struggles with all her 
strength.  
Mahabir suddenly yanks her away from everyone and strikes a massive slap 
across her face. She falters back, stunned. He paces up to her. She is grunting, looks 
up at him. Suddenly another full-blooded slap, harder than before. She drops to the 
ground.  
Music begins.  
Mahabir 
Haanthan ne baandho...  
As the men proceed to do so, then pick her up to put in the vehicle, we move 
away from them to the night atmosphere in these outskirts of Delhi.

{Dark Night} Song 1 
 
Music plays. We see night in the outskirts. Lyrics begin – What mystery lies 
behind your face? What are the stories that you never tell?  
Intriguing atmosphere of night. The Marshall jeep is seen driving. 
We enter a village settlement. It is dead night.  
We come to a house in the village. Some lights are on inside. From a distance, 
we see a Skoda car drive up to the house and two people emerge from it. We move 
closer to the house.

Music fades out as we find Veera in the yard. She lies dumped on the floor, 
hands and mouth still tied. A dim bulb is burning. She appears senseless. 
Door of the room opens. Veera’s eyes open. Panic returns to her as she sees 
someone striding towards her. She tries to pull herself up. She looks at the man.  
It is Mahabir, he crouches in front of her. She recoils from him in savage fear. 
He raises her by the side of her head to sit against the wall and removes her gag. She 
is yelping. He looks at her.  
Mahabir 
Naam bol apna 
Veera whimpers from her chest.  
Veera  
Please... please mujhe... jaane do... please...  
Mahabir 
Naam ka ha tera? 
Veera  
(senselessly) Mujhe ghar jaana hai... Please... please... 
He gives her small slaps on her face to revive her.  
Mahabir 
Naam... naam...  
 
Veera continues to plead senselessly.  
Mahabir 
(screams) Arey chup... 
She is shocked to silence. Mahabir grabs her by the hair of her nape.  
Mahabir 
Bol... 
Veera  
Veera... 
Mahabir 
Veera kaha? 
Veera  
Veera Tripathy... 
There is a stir among the men who are standing at the door, hiding their face.  
Fat Man 
Ho ga...? Hain...? 
Mahabir is looking at Veera.  
Mahabir 
(pulling hair more) Manek Tripathy ki beti hai? 
 
Veera  
(quickly) Haan... haan... 
 

 
 
He stares at her. Then pushes her to the floor. He is looking at her in thought, 
she is looking at him in fear. He moves forward to her quickly, she shreiks, panics. 
But he grabs the cloth and gags her mouth in some annoyance. She stares at him. He 
walks back to the door. She is looking. The door closes. She closes her eyes.

All the men of the group are sitting in great tension. Buffaloes are seen in the 
cattleyard in the background. Silence. 
Then the fat man who was seen getting out of the car speaks –  
Fat Man 
Hajaaran ber keh chukaoon in ameeran te door raha kar... saban ki 
pahonch howe ae, inte uljhega to ye teri khaale udedh denge badan 
se... Ab siltiyo yaate...  
The effiminate man who had got off the car with the fat man speaks now –  
Babli  
Par ye jaanta nahin tha na ki vo kaun hai... 
Fat Man 
Itti baddi odi gaadi mein kaun chale ae...? Hain...? 
Tonk  
Haan par Tripathy ki chhori...?

Haan... Tripathy ki chhori... Police, Home Guard, BSF, Millaetry sagle

Silence. He speaks again – to all but hinting at Mahabir.  
Fat Man 
Insaan ne apni okaat pata honi chaiye... Gaand mein na goo, hagne 
chale pahaad... 
He suddenly looks at Mahabir, who has been looking at him, and challenges –  
Fat 
 
Kaha ghoor ro ae... hain... Ka dekh ra ae...? 
Mahabir 
Teri gaande... phat te huye dekh ra oon.  
Ominous silence.  
Mahabir 
(indicating Babli) Ya ke jaisa ho gaya ae tu bi... 
Tau

Fat man is looking at Mahabir. He speaks after a moment –  
Fat Man 
Toye yoon na kehna... Ab yo baat reh jaagi.  
 

 
 
 
Fat man suddenly pulls out his gun and points at Mahabir to shoot, speaking 
meanwhile – 
Fat Man 
Ya ke sagle kisse abhi ke abhi nibtaye doon full and final... hain...

Panic in the group as Mahabir flinches.

Veera’s face as she is being woken up tenderly by someone.  
Goru (OC)  
Suniye…, uth jaiye… Uthiye… 
Veera opens her eyes, bleary, looks.  
Goru   
Gaurav...  
Veera comes to, flinches.  
Goru  
(sliding hand to her knee) Ghabraiye nahin... 
She looks at him.  
Goru 
Goru Goru bolte hain humko... Hum dhyaan rakhenge aapka, theek

His hand has moved to her thigh, his face is innocent. She is stiff.  
Goru 
Baad mein baat karenge... hain na…? Abhi humko jaana hai, kyonki…  
Suddenly the door opens and in a rush another man called Aadoo comes in. 
Aadoo  
Chal chal chal chal chal... 
 
The room is flushed with sudden tension, Goru has pulled his hand and now 
orders Veera – 
Goru   
Arey uth, jaldi kar... 
Aadoo quickly grabs a few bags and things. Veera looks, rises.  
 
A cloth has been tied to her mouth again as Goru and Aadoo lead her out. 
Morning light strains into her eyes, she is taken through a path to where some men are 
standing. All faces are covered, looking. She can feel danger and hurry.  
 
Mahabir is standing with the old man in the yard. The fat and effiminate man 
are absent. Mahabir turns to Goru and Aadoo. 
Mahabir 
Chalo...  
They hurry with Veera, Mahabir turns to the old man.  
Mahabir 
Bharoso waise ee na ae kaaye ko... Kar diyo jo karna ae...  
 

 
 
 
 
Outside, in the lane, Veera is led to the Marshall jeep and made to sit.  
Inside, Mahabir turns and walks out. The old man is looking.  
Mahabir rushes to the driver’s seat and starts the jeep. The vehicle rushes 
away.  
Morning atmosphere is this village in the outskirts of Delhi.  
  
The jeep drives out of the village.

A Tempo Traveller is parked on the side of the road on a hillock. The village  
is seen in the distance below. Tonk gets off the vehicle, looking.  
The jeep roars in from behind.   
Mahabir shuts the door of the jeep and rushes to the tempo where Veera is 
being made to clamber in. The Tempo rear is secured. Tonk and Mahabir get into the 
front of the tempo and shut the door. The tempo moves out, leaving the village 
behind.  
Mahabir turns back to look through the trap window into the rear. His face is 
seen from the rear. Veera sits to one side, her mouth tied. Goru and Aadoo are sitting 
on the two side walls. They look at Mahabir.  
Mahabir 
(to all) Phonan ne aaf kar do sagle... 
Pause. Then – 
Mahabir 
Aaj unki lugai apne haath lagi hai... Aaj apna din ae... 
Pause. Then Tonk, who is driving, makes a loud invocation.  
 
Tonk  
Bolo baba Kisan Das ki  
 
Everyone joins enthusiastically – 
All 
 
Jai. Je bola.... 
Tonk  
Bolo Lakkad Maharaj ki 
All 
 
Jai. Je bola... 
Veera looks, numb. Spirits of the men seem to rise with the invocations. 
Aadoo adjusts to a more comfortable position. Goru passes a secret consoling gesture 
to Veera. Veera wonders. Meanwhile –  
Tonk  
Bolo Gaam Khede ki

The Highway  
 
The journey begins. As Mahabir sits in front, looking straight, many things 
running through his mind. As Veera sits in the rear – mouth tied and living this 
nightmare. As the tempo traveller runs on the Highway. The landscape runs on both 
sides in different speeds.  
 
Long play Highway Theme.  
 
Hours and hours on the highway. The scenery changes, the light changes. The 
tempo crosses from Haryana into Rajasthan.  
Mahabir sitting in the same position, looking ahead as evening light falls on 
his face. Veera in the same position as well, but whimpering now, begins to sob.

Dargah Lanes, Building 
 
The Dargah of Khwaja Gharib Nawaz beset in the lanes of Ajmer, seen from a 
height in early night. Various sounds in the distance. Qawwali playing.  
 
Backs of Mahabir and Tonk as they walk down the crowded lanes of Ajmer.  
Tonk is connected to the music he hears in the lanes. Mahabir is headed for a 
particular spot.  
A man is standing at a building window, looking down. He suddenly springs 
on seeing something. He has seen Mahabir who has reached a spot and is looking up. 
The man on the terrace makes tense gestures for Mahabir to wait there, and look the 
other way and leaves to come down.  
Mahabir turns towards Tonk who is looking at music cds in the shanty shop.  
Tonk  
Qawwali ko koi latest number aayo ae...?  
 
 
Hawker 
Baat suno bhai qawwali latest nahin suni jaati... 
Tonk   
To ka suni jaave hai...? 
The man from the terrace, who is wearing a white skull cap, emerges from the 
building, looks at Mahabir, looks away and walks down the lane. Meanwhile – 
Hawker 
Khaas kalaam hai ye... Maula Ghareeb Nawaz ki shaan mein...  
Tonk   
(OC) Aur puraani...? 
Hawker 
Bahot zyaada...  
Tonk  
Pher theek hai...  
Mahabir and Tonk follow the man down the lane.

crossroad, can not see the man in the skull cap.  
Sharaf

Mahabir turns, the man emerges from the dark on a platform. Mahabir turns to 
him. Tonk reaches. The man perks on seeing Tonk, but recognizes him. Tonk salutes 
him. The man turns to Mahabir. He is tense, tending to sarcasm, speaks –  
Sharaf 
Matlab ki kamaal kar diya tumne bhai yaane jhande gaad diye kasam 
se… Ab to Masha Allah kisse-kahaniyon mein charche honge 
tumhaare… 
Mahabir

Sharaf 
Yaane ki bhai dopahar ko khabar mili aur maine tumhara phone try 
shuroo kiya... 
Tonk

The man looks at Mahabir, speaks –  
Sharaf 
Kya hai na ki bhai ab tum tum nahin rahe, mashallah hasti ho gaye ho 
famous, apna consignment le kar galli mein ghusoge do minute mein 
khushboo phail jayegi saare Ajmer mein… Ab tum yahan nahin ruk

Tempo Parked in Ajmer Lane 
 
The tempo parked in a dark lane. All except one restaurant is shut.   
 
Light falls on Veera as the rear flap of the tempo opens. She is sitting in the 
corner, gagged and tied. Light shines in her eyes. Someone slides in and closes the 
flap back.  
Goru  
Hum hain... 
She looks at him.  
He moves to her and as she braces, he touches her face. She is looking at him. 
He is caressing her face.  
Goru  
Bukhaar to nahin hai na kaheen...? Tch...  
He pulls the gag off her mouth, touches her lips. Then –  
Goru  
Sunn ho gaye honge na... honth...?  
He begins to rub her lips. She pulls her face away.  
Goru 
Arey...? (sniggers) Hum aapki side mein hain... Aur ye baat kisi ko bol 
mat deejiyga... Bahot danger log hain ye… Kya karenge aapke saath... 
Aap to soch bhi nahin sakti hain... ki aisa kiya bhi ja sakta hai... magar 
hum hain... 
He moves his hand and begins to caress her side.  
Goru  
(continues) Hum dhyaan rakhenge… 
She is looking at him, confused. He is getting charged, she is stiffening. 
Goru 
Aapko apne ghar jaana hai na...? Haan…? Apne ma-baap ke paas..., 
apne logon mein… Jaana hai na vaapas…?  
Tears begin to come to her eyes. Suddenly Goru freezes and withdraws. 
Mahabir (OC) Jaldi kar le... Aadoo... 
Goru  
(scared) Shh…  
He quickly gags her back, moves away from her and cleans his face with his 
hands in nervousness. Then he moves to the flap and makes to open it but just then 
the flap is opened. Mahabir is there, looks at Goru. 
Goru  
Aa gaye...? Paani pilo diyo ae, khaana baad mein denge.  
 

 
 
 
 
Mahabir is looking at him suspiciously. He is making to get out of the tempo – 
Goru  
Hum udhar baithe hain... Aadoo hai vahan...  
Mahabir 
Baith ja 
Goru immediately withdraws and sits. Aadoo comes to the shutter to get in.  
 
The flap of the tempo rear is secured.  
 
Mahabir starts the Tempo engine. He is sitting on the driver’s seat. The man in 
the cap – whose name is Sharaf – is sitting next to him, having covered his face with a 
scarf. He does some quick relegious invocation. Tonk is next to him.  
Mahabir

The camera point-of-view moves through the interiors of the salt factory. It 
comes to a staircase, turns into a large defunct factory floor, and reaches Mahabir who 
is standing near a make-shift room arrangement. He looks up.  
Goru is leading Veera, Tonk is following behind. Mahabir turns to ask – 
Mahabir 
Theek hai...? 
Aadoo  
(OC) Haan sab theek hai... 
Veera is brought to the mattress on the side. There are no windows there, only 
high ventilators.  
 
Aadoo opens her mouth gag. Her hands.  
Goru places a plate with some food for her.  
Veera is standing as everyone leaves and lights go off.

Veera is eating the food.  
 
She is standing, then walks. She is limping. She walks to the ventilators. She 
can hear chatter and the sound of someone playing the mouth organ in the night. She 
can not see outside at all. She tries raising her left hand. It is paining. She walks more, 
checking her limbs.  
 
Time transition. Veera has been lying down, she is looking at the door. There 
is a narrow rim of light at the opening. She looks at it for a while. The men are not 
heard chattering any more, faint sound of a qawwali can be heard. She gets up, moves 
towards the door. She reaches the door, pushes it slightly. The door is open. She 
withdraws, her heartbeat rises. She waits, then she pushes the door to open more. 
Nothing happens. Veera turns quickly towards the ventilators. She can not hear any 
chatter, just the faint sound of a qawwali on a CD player. She walks back to the door. 
Waits. Then opens the door and looks. The staircase is dark. No one is seen. She 
closes her eyes for a second, then tip-toes forward. She climbs down the steps, slowly 
and carefully. The stairs becomes darker as she walks forward. She falters, hits 
something,  hurries down the steps. It is very dark now. We can only hear the the 
sounds of her movement.  
Then she falters in a big way, something falls, big sound in the dead night, she 
grimaces. There is some other sound too. Of someone else moving. And light comes 
on. Mahabir is standing there, next to his make-shift bed. He has switched on the 
light. She stares at him. He is looking at her. Then suddenly he paces up to her, she 
shreiks and withdraws in mortal fear, falls back on some sacks. He reaches his hand to 
her, she whimpers, he holds the hair on her nape, picks her up, then turns and walks 
her out. 
 
He takes her through the passage. She is in pain, in horror, she does not know 
what he is going to do. He walks her out.

The rest of the group is gathered around a small fire near the pillars in the 
compound. A small CD player is playing the qawwali. The men turn and look.  
Mahabir emerges holding Veera and walks across the yard towards the salt 
pan.  
Aadoo  
Arey...? 
They all rush towards Mahabir. 
Aadoo  
Kya hua bhai...?  
Goru  
Haan, kya hua...?  
Mahabir 
(striding forward) Bhaagna chaah ri...  
The others are confused.  
Aadoo  
Haan to...?  
Mahabir does not answer. He leads her to the end of the factory area, where 
the salt pan begins and pushes her away. She falters, turns and stares at him. The 
others join him.  
Mahabir 
Chal bhaag... 
She is gaping at him, tense and scared and breathing heavily. She does not 
move.  
Mahabir 
Kaha hua? Bhaag...  
She stands there, looking at him, at the others, wondering what they might do, 
what her chances are, why he is doing this. She stands for a moment. Then she turns 
and runs.  
Sharaf (OC) Arey...? 
Mahabir and the others are seen looking at her as she runs away into the 
distance. She runs through the junk on the way, then is seen running down the rail 
tracks into the open.

Veera’s face as she runs desperately. What can be worse than being captive to 
these people? So she runs.  
And runs. She looks back, runs.  
She staggers to a fall, then screams to push herself and gets up and runs.  
She runs and slows down with fatigue, still running but faltering now with the 
intoxication of tiredness and she can not run any more and she walks but is swaying 
and a few steps and she falls to her knees, whining as her lungs tear and she bundles 
down with head on her hands in front and breathes and breathes and falls to the side 
and breathes. She lies there. After a moment she opens her eyes, looks around.

Fear of the Unknown{Song # 2} 
 
Vastness, emptiness, white ground glistening in the skylight. And nothing.  
The qawwali that the men were hearing on the CD player now plays in the 
soundtrack. Its about the vastness of existence, the darkness all around and the fear of 
being alone.  
Veera collects herself, begins to feel nervous, scared.  
She stands, music builds. She looks around – nothing. Where should she go? 
She turns and looks back. She looks into the vastness again. She is seized by fear, she 
begins to walk back, she runs.  
She runs in the white vastness, she runs back.  
She runs all the way to the salt factory. She runs back with all her might.

Veera is seen coming in.  
She runs, walks up, breathless, out of strength. She comes forwards and falls 
on Mahabir. He steps back, removes her, lets her fall to the ground. Music ends. She 
lies there, sick and defeated and breathing sourly.  
Aadoo steps up to lift her.  
Mahabir 
Hat peeche...  
Aadoo stops. 
Mahabir 
Apni marji se bhaagi... Apne aap hi jaagi bheetar...   
Veera stays to take a few breaths.

Tonk jumps off the tempo, followed by Aadoo. Tonk joins Mahabir and 
Sharaf who are sipping tea near the driver’s seat of the tempo.

Then they hear a voice –

The men look up. Aadoo is coming up with a cup of tea for Tonk. Veera’s 
voice is coming from the ventilator of the make-shift room. 
Veera

Sharaf comes to full attention, faces the building where the voice is coming 
from. Aadoo looks at Mahabir, then turns to ask Veera  
Aadoo  
Kya hai...?  
Veera

Aadoo again looks at Mahabir who has an annoyed look.

Veera is speaking into the ventilator.

is with him.  
Veera looking to the right side. She is blank, silent for a while. Then – 
Veera

Everyone looks at her.  
Veera 
Maine aisi jagah kabhi nahin dekhi... Hum jab bhi baahar jaate hain, 
holiday par, to saara waqt to hotel mein hi rehte hain... To fayda kya 
hua? Us se achcha hai Dilli mein hi kisi hotel mein check-in kar lete. 
Hotel to sab jagah ek hi hote hain…  
 
She realizes, looks around. The others are a little surprised.  
Veera

nahin yahan, koi film chal rahi hai aur main dekh rahi hoon… control

Mahabir

Veera

She looks to the side as though she is not there, so that she is not sent back. 
Mahabir walks to the other side. Goru comes with a cup of tea for her. 
Goru  
Haan... 
She turns, takes the tea cup. Goru passes a subtle look to her that he is with 
her. Tonk is the only one who has been looking at her straight, with a mystified smile.  
Veera 
(for the tea) Thanks. (pause) Anyway, yahan aa kar bahot achcha lag 
raha hai so thank you... 
She says quickly as though she intends to not speak at all. But adds – 
Veera 
Andar lag raha tha ulti ho jayegi… tab hi maine bola, magar ab bahot 
behtar feel kar rahi hoon… Fresh air, taazi hawa ke baare mein… Main

Veera comes in from the bathing area, sees him. He shuts the door behind and 
moves to her quickly.  
Goru 
Aapko aise bhaagne ki kya jaroorat thi...?  
 
She is looking at him defensively. He reaches close to her.  
Goru 
Hum keh rahe hain na ki hum karenge kuch jugaad.  
 
He comes closer.

He touches her neck, licks his finger.

She looks towards the door. Goru follows the look, then turns quickly to see.  
Mahabir is standing in the room.  
Goru leaves her instantly, steps back, she moves away. Goru looks at Mahabir 
in nervousness, is trying to figure out what to say.  
Mahabir walks into the room. Goru suddenly smiles.  
Goru  
Hum jaante hain aap kya soch rahe hain... 
He sniggers as he walks forward, Mahabir crashes a massive slap on his face. 
Goru recoils, holds his face, then smiles again.  
 

 
 
Goru 
Aisa bhi to ho sakta hai aap ghalat samajh rahe ho… Aise nahin ho

Then he smiles. Then turns and walks out.

Mahabir is standing against the tempo. Veera is sitting, sipping water, trying 
to feel better. Mahabir moves, looks at Veera, then walks across to the side. He stops, 
feels Veera’s presence behind. He walks to the front of the tempo, a few more steps 
ahead. He walks behind a bush, looks back, then begins to take a leak. After a second, 
he hears the sound of Veera getting out of the tempo. He springs, but he is already 
urinating, has to finish. He tries to look, but can not see anything. He tries to finish in 
a hurry.  
Mahabir rushes to the tempo, Veera is not in the carrier. He swears and looks 
around, then rushes to the middle of the road. He looks in both directions. Then he 
turns back towards the tempo and runs. He reaches the ravines, looks around, tense. 
Then he takes out his gun and rushes down a ditch. He looks around, runs up a slope. 
He is seen running across till he comes to a spot and hears –

Mahabir turns around and stands, breathing heavily. After a few seconds, 
Veera comes out from behind some shrubs, walks up.  
Mahabir 
(screams) Kahaon gayee thi...? Hain…?  
She looks at him.  
Veera  
(attitude) Tum kahan gaye the? 
Mahabir 
(sharp, seething) Dimagh kharaab ho gaya hai tera tu moso pooch rahi 
ae? 
Veera 
Tumhein jaana ho sakta hai to mujhe bhi to jaana ho sakta hai na...?  
She looks away, corrects her clothes.   
 
 
Veera 
Sochna chahiye...  
 
 

 
 
 
He is speechless, staring at her, and as she corrects her clothes, his eye 
involuntarily slips to her chest. She catches the look, he looks away, caught. Silence. 
Mahabir 
(stiffly) Chal... 
Veera  
Hmm... 
 
She walks across him, more womanly than before. He follows her, awkward. 
She looks back at him. They walk ahead. 
Aadoo comes above the ditch near the tempo.  
Aadoo  
Kaha hua...? 
Mahabir 
Ho gi baat? 
Aadoo  
Haan... 
Veera is climbing up the ditch. Mahabir is avoiding supporting her from 
behind. Aadoo pulls her, speaking to Mahabir.  
Aadoo 
Aaj phone karego Tonk... yaake mobile mein battery laga ker, ar pher 
do din baad humsu milego... (to Veera) Aaja... 
Veera  
Main aage baithoongi 
Mahabir looks at her.  
Mahabir 
(flares up) Kasam se haddiyan ne tod doongo ghani bakwaad kee to 
Veera looks back at him. 
Veera 
(soft assurance) Theek hai… Tod do haddiyan ne… Tasalli kar lo. Par 
baithoongi main aage hi.  
Mahabir does not know whether to tear her apart or turn away, he is looking at 
her.  
Aadoo 
Problem na hai...  
 
Mahabir looks at Aadoo. Aadoo shakes his head. 
 Aadoo 
Main raoonga na side mein. Donon rahenge dono sidan mein, aur ka...? 
 
Mahabir turns and walks away. Aadoo moves Veera towards the front.  
 
The bonnet cover of the tempo is lowered. Veera is sitting in the middle of the 
tempo cabin. Mahabir has closed the bonnet, comes around and climbs to the driver’s 
seat and shuts the door. They are not looking at each other. 
  
 

 
 
Veera  
Sorry...  
 
He looks at her, looks away.  
Veera 
Maine bahot kharaab se baat kee. Strange... Itni budtameezi se to main 
kisi se baat nahin karti... Kabhi nahin... Mere baare mein to ye hai ki 
main bahot well-behaved... I mean tameezdaar hoon... Aur tumse to... 
Sorry... Actually ulti kar kar ke...  
Mahabir 
(cuts) Tu chup rahegi...? Chup rahegi...? 
Veera  
...sorry bol rahi hoon... 
 
Mahabir 
(scolds) Main bol raha hoon sory? Hain? Hum yahan tameej dikhaane 
aaye hain...?  
 
She looks at him.  
Mahabir 
Apne baap ke ghar ja kar dikhaiyyo tameej... 
 
Veera looks at him.  
Veera  
(agrees) Hmm... 
 
She turns away easily. He starts the engine. She gets a little comfortable. 
Mahabir 
(calling, OC) Arey Chal... 
Aadoo  
(OC) Chal chal cha chal chal.  
Aadoo comes in shuts the door.  
Aadoo

Veera gets more comfortable as the engine races.

The Highway Again (Part One) 
 
The highway rolls, seen from the front of the tempo traveller.  
 
Veera sits in the tempo, looking in front. She feels comfortable. She looks, she 
is noticing things. She is getting interested. She has never seen sights like this before.  
The highway theme. The landscape runs on both sides. Hours and hours on the 
highway. The terrain changes. The journey has moved into the desert.

the distance below. The sun is setting. Veera looks at the sun. Then - 
Veera  
Hi... 
 
The sun is clear on the horizon. 
Veera  
Tum vohi ho, Dilli waale...? 
She sits on the dune, continues looking at the sun.  
Veera  
Badal gaye ho... Looking good. Handsome... 
She lies down on the sand. She speads her limbs, stretches, relaxes.

The Highway Again (Part Two) 
The tempo is parked in a small village in the desert at night. Someone is 
sleeping in a blanket on the legde just behind the tempo. Inside, Veera is making her 
bed. She looks towards the cabin, comes to the trap window to look. Mahabir is 
sleeping there. Veera lies down to go to sleep.  
Next morning, a train comes whizzing on the tracks and crosses. Veera feels a 
gush. The tempo is parked behind at a distance. Mahabir and Aadoo are standing 
there. Veera is fascinated.  
The tempo crosses the railway crossing.  
The journey continues as Mahabir looks ahead and drives, many things 
running through his mind. As Veera sits next to him and looks out of the tempo. They 
are alone in the cabin.  
The tempo is crossing an area crowded by trucks.  
Veera raises her shawl over her head, largely covering her face. She looks 
towards Mahabir for approval. He glances. She slinks a little lower to be more 
inconspicious. Mahabir looks away, she looks front.  
Rajasthan passing.  
Later Mahabir drives and Aadoo sits next to him. Veera is at the trap window, 
looking at the highway in front.  
Music changes as a tea glass emerges from below the lowered flap of the 
tempo. We see that Aadoo takes it from the road outside and walks away. We see 
Veera’s face come down to the floor of the tempo to look outside through the gap in 
the shutter. Aadoo is walking away to the tea stall to return the glass, Mahabir is 
standing over there, finishing his tea, making to leave. Veera lies down on the floor of 
the tempo and looks out. A group of  Rajasthani musicians are gathered in a shack, 
playing music. This is a crossroads near the Panjab border. Mahabir and Aadoo are 
walking up candidly, talking to each other. Veera watches. Mahabir indicates to 
Aadoo, Aadoo comes to the tempo rear, closes the flap. 
Rajasthan fades away into the evening.  
The Highway rolls at night. The journey moves into Panjab.  
The tempo’s point of view moves up as the road rises and turns into an iron 
bridge. Music recedes as a barricade arm with a Stop sign is lowered in the middle of 
the bridge.

Iron Bridge  
 
Mahabir, who was driving, has braked. Policemen emerge from the sides and 
rush to the tempo as it stops. Mahabir looks if he can go back. A police jeep drives in 
after the tempo. Mahabir turns front, looks straight. Aadoo is looking at him, at the 
cops.  
The tempo is trapped in the iron bridge on the stream. Policemen rush to the 
tempo cabin.   
Policemen are shining torches on Mahabir and Aadoo.  
Aadoo  
Ka hua sirjee...? Ka baat bai...?  
Other policemen are taking the registration number down. 
Police 1 
Peeche carrier ich kee ae...? 
Aadoo  
Kuch nahin hai sirjee... 
Inspector 
Kuch bhi nahin, hain.. Khaali le ke ja raha hai tempo...? 
Mahabir 
Ghar ke samaan ae bas...

Aadoo and Mahabir exchange a look.  
Aadoo 
(forward with relief) Bilkul koi Rajasthan ka maal nahin hai. Maa ki 
kasam. 
Police 1

The policeman opens the door and takes off the key. 
Police 1

Inspector 
Dikha apne ghar da saaman.  
 
Aadoo comes out of the tempo.  
Police 2

Aadoo walks up to the Inspector.  
Police 2

Mahabir comes down from the tempo as Aadoo begins to speak with the 
Inspector.  
Aadoo  
Sir ek minute... 
Inspector

Aadoo

Haan dasso ki baat karni ae...?  
Aadoo

The inspector grabs and pushes Aadoo menacingly onto the tempo.  
Inspector 
Teri aukaat hai... hain...? Tu mainu rishvat dega...? Saale do take de...? 
Chal khol daala… Dikha ki chori keeta ae...  
Aadoo looks at Mahabir, then a policeman grabs and takes him to the rear. 
Mahabir remains standing at the front door, begins to look around.  
At the rear end, the policeman reaches with Aadoo and checks the flap.  
Inside, Veera is sitting tense. She has been listening.  
Police 1 
(OC) Kiddar tau khulda ae...? Khol... 
Mahabir turns to the tempo, suddenly rises into the cabin and lowers the seat. 
He quickly takes out a gun from under the seat, checks the bullets.  
Police 1 
Kholta hai ya lagaoon ek danda? 
Aadoo is very tense. The other policemen file behind him.  
Inside, Veera hears the sound of the flap being unfastened. She is getting more 
and more tense.  
Mahabir tucks the gun under his belt and moves stealthily to the rear, emerges 
near Aadoo and the cops, hand on his stomach and ready for action.   
Inside, Veera hears the sound of the hook unfastening.  
Police 2 (OC) Doosra khol...  
She suddenly moves to climb up into the milk compartment. The bolt of the 
flap is heard unfastening. Veera stops. Why is she hiding? She climbs back, to show 
herself. She stops midways. She is throbbing in anxiety.  
Outside, the flap is lowered.  
Mahabir takes out his gun, moves and points at the backs of the policemen.  
All the policemen are looking inside the tempo, they do not notice Mahabir.  
Torches shining into the tempo rear, the policemen standing, looking in, 
Mahabir aiming the gun to their back. A silent moment. Nothing happens. 
 
There is nothing in the tempo rear. Just some household things.  

 
 
Aadoo is looking inside, surprised.  
Mahabir is looking, moves away the gun, tucks it in again.  
A policeman slides into the rear of the tempo, shines torch and looks.  
The Inspector turns to Aadoo, puts his arm around Aadoo as the policeman is 
seen getting off the rear and closing the flap.  
Inspector 
(smiles) Darasal imandaaran waali shakl nahin na hai teri... Is liye 
thoda confuse ho gaye si...  
The policeman laugh.  
Inspector 
Chal... dudki ho... 
There is an uneasy moment as Mahabir and Aadoo look at the rear.  
Inspector 
Bura maan gaya...? Hain...? Tempo zapt karwaoon...?  
Aadoo  
(laugh) Nahin nahin... 
Inspector 
To nikal... 
Aadoo

Mahabir sits into the tempo cabin and shuts the door. He is shocked. Aadoo 
comes and sits. Mahabir looks at him.

hugs him. He gets stiff. She holds him. He is awkward. She holds his arm and lifts it  
to her back so that he holds her. Then she puts her face on his side. He feels a softness 
run through his body, he holds her with his other arm as well. She holds him properly. 
He holds her tighter. Her eyes close and she exhales as a relief covers her.  
After a while she parts, he looks away. She does her hair, looks at him. He 
opens the door. She holds his shoulder for support as she climbs. He shuts her door.  
And walks back to his side, as though nothing has happened and holds the 
door to open it. He waits, looking down. He waits a moment with himself, then opens

She holds it, Tonk begins to take pictures with a small digital camera, she sees 
that is a bangla newspaper.  
Veera  
Ye language kaun si hai? 
Aadoo  
Bangali... 
Veera  
Ki unhein lage hum Bengal mein hain....? Hmmmm, smart...  
Tonk removes the camera.  
Tonk  
Oye apharan huya ae tero... Dukhi to lag ja…

Aadoo  
Achcha chal hasna band... Serious, serious...  
Veera  
Teri shakl dekh kar koi ghanta serious ho sakta hai...? 
She laughs. 
Veera  
Aadoo... 
She laughs more.  
Aadoo  
Okay lo main peeche mud jaata hoon...  
Aadoo turns back, facing Mahabir who is standing at the door.  
Mahabir is looking strictly at the proceedings. Veera is attempting to control 
her laughter behind. Aadoo looks at Mahabir, gets into thought.

Mahabir sitting on a step with Tonk having tea and mathri. A mechanic is

Veera is seen standing on the terrace in the distance. Mahabir is keeping watch on 
Veera as well.  
 
Meanwhile –

Jagah theek ae... Samaan-sumoon lena hai to market hai...  
Aadoo comes up to them.  
Mahabir 
Latte lene hain laundiya ke... Vo aise alag su na dikhe...

Aadoo scratches his head, looks down in physical discomfort.  
Mahabir

Silence. Aadoo is sitting, head craned down. Tonk is looking the other way. 
Mahabir is looking straight. Veera is seen on the terrace in the distance. 
Veera is eating some sweet, looking around happily at the town.  
The sun is setting on Noor Mahal.

Open Courtyard,  Deserted House  Front 
 
A courtyard on the first floor at night. Mahabir is seen sitting to one side, 
doing something. Aadoo is seen coming up the stairs followed by Veera. He looks at 
Mahabir and stops, returns to her. Veera is completely covered in a Chaadara.  
Aadoo  
(nervous) Meri maan, aaj rehne de. Aaj mood theek na hai bhai ka 
Veera  
To main theek karti hoon na mood... 
Aadoo  
Arey... 
Veera crosses him, walks towards Mahabir. Aadoo quickly turns and slinks 
away.  
Veera realizes as she reaches behind that Mahabir is humming a tune. She 
slows down, tiptoes softly to reach him. She listens. Mahabir hums for a while as he 
changes laces of his shoe. She moves again. Mahabir turns suddenly to her. She gets a 
start.  
Mahabir 
Paagal ae...? Pher na kariyo, samjhi? 
Veera notices that he is very tense.  
Veera  
(easily) Hmm. Samajh gayee. 
She comes across. He looks at her.  
Mahabir 
(gruff) Kaha baat hai?  
Veera  
Dhaenteran...  
She opens the chaadara, shows off the new ethnic clothes that she is wearing.  
Veera  
Tumne kaha tha mere liye kapde lene... Aadoo ne bataya... 
He turns away.  
Veera  
Acting mat karo, bahot achchi lag rahi hoon main...  
Pause, he continues with his shoes. She sits, then begins to hum the tune that 
he was humming. He looks at her.  
Veera  
Ye kaun sa gaana hai?   
He does not reply. Looks away.  
Veera  
Haan...? 
Mahabir 
(rude) Tujhe kaam ka hai?  

 
 
Veera  
Mujhe ye gaana sunna hai... (settles down) Ye kaam hai 
He looks at her.  
Mahabir 
(with finality) Dekh tu abhi chali ja. Chal... 
She remains there, looking at him with tenderness.  
Veera  
Mahabir Bhaati... 
He does not reply.  
Veera  
Bahot achchi tune hai ye...  
Pause. She hums the tune again.  
He is getting disturbed, remains looking down. Then –  
Veera  
Batao na, kahan suni…?  
Mahabir 
(suddenly screams) Kyon bataoon main...? Hain...?  
He is aware that he has over-reacted. He looks down.  
Veera  
Ab to zaroor jaanna hai mujhe. Kaun sa gaana hai? 
 
Mahabir looks at her in irritation.  
Mahabir 
Gaana na hai...  
Veera  
To phir? Gaana nahin hai to tumne kahan suna...?  
Mahabir 
Meri ma gaati thi...  
Veera  
Really...? Wow... Tumhaare liye gaati theen...? Haan? Bolo na please...  
Mahabir 
Arey haan mere liye gaati thi... Vo kaam karti thi to... main uske saath 
hota tha to... main rota tha... to vo gaati thi... Ho gaya...? 
Veera  
Tum rote the...? Oh... 
She finds this very endearing. He is befuddled.  
Veera  
To tumhaari mother tumhaare saath hi rehti hain?  
He looks at her, gets worked up in a spark, stands.  
Mahabir 
Chal, bahot ho gaya, bhittarr ja. (stern) Chal uth...  
She does not move, looks up at him. 
Veera  
Kya hai na, mera mood nahin hai jaane ka.  
He gets synged.  

Mahabir 
Bahot par nikal aaye hain tere? 
Veera 
Hai na? Aur darr to bilkul khatm ho gaya hai. Aur bura mat manna 
magar ab to kaafi cute lagne lage ho tum mujhe...  
He looks at her, unable to react.  
Veera 
Achcha rote kyon thhe tum? Haan? Batao na? Kaun tang karta tha 
baba ko?  
He turns to her again, in anger again, but looks vulnerable. Then turns and 
walks away.  
Veera 
(calling after) Achcha sorry... Sorry, nahin poochoongi... Promise 
nahin poochoongi... Suno to...  
He walks across the terrace, hurries down the steps. Then stops in between, 
gathers himself, then walks down. But slows down. He can hear Veera humming his 
mother’s tune. He looks up.  
Veera comes to the edge of the terrace, humming the tune. Mahabir hides at 
the wall. She does not know he is there. He stands and listens. He starts to become 
unstettled.

The Lullaby {Song 4} Part One 
 
Mahabir driving the tempo, the memories in his mind. Veera sitting next to 
him, humming the tune that she had heard from Mahabir last night.  
Flashback. The lady, now working in the brick kiln. She is pushing a wheel-
barrow.  
Flashback. The boy, now thirteen, is sitting on the floor of a crowded moving 
bus, weeping.  
Mahabir driving the tempo. Veera is singing the song. The song is choking 
Mahabir and he is surprised by that. But he does not want to admit to it, holds himself 
strongly.  
Flashback, the lady is holding an infant Mahabir in her arms, sitting in the 
fields near the kiln and singing the lullaby to him. This is the same song that we heard 
Veera hum in the beginning titles. The infant is crying. The lady is singing.  
 
The tempo moves from Panjab to Himachal Pradesh. 
 
Mahabir wakes with a jerk. He has been sleeping in the rear as the tempo 
moves in the day. Veera instantly puts her hand on his forehead, strokes his head. He 
is in shallow sleep, looks at her caring face. He comes to his senses, feels strange. She 
stoops more towards him, strokes his head. He closes his eyes. She watches over him, 
comforts him as he sleeps. He keeps his eyes closed. 
Flashback. The lady singing while working in the fields. The kid is tied to her 
back with cloth. The lady’s caring, loving face as she sings to him. 
Mahabir driving the tempo.  
 
Veera singing the song in the journey. 
 
The tempo travels in the hills.  
 
Veera walks into the market place of a hill town called Rampur under the 
watchful eyes of Mahabir. Her head is covered in a shawl. They move into a shop.

Mahabir looks at her, insecure.

She realizes that he does not know. Then she comes forward to speak –  
Veera 
Tumhein mujhse promise karna hoga Mahabir, ki ye sab khatam hote 
hi tum unse miloge. Kahan hain vo...?  
He looks at her.  
Mahabir 
Gaam mein...

walks up, turns to look at Mahabir, then climbs in. Mahabir walks up. He comes up to 
the tempo rear, looks at her. She smiles at him. He looks down, closes the flap. He 
stands there for a moment. He walks to the front seat, gets ups.  
The tempo runs on the highway in the hills. Music ends.

Mahabir returns to the tempo, moves to the front to check something as the 
western song begins to play on the music system. It is a song like – ‘Don’t you wish 
your girlfriend was hot like me’. Mahabir sees that Veera is on the front seat, listening 
to the music. Aadoo is on the ground on the other side. Veera starts to get with the 
music, with the full western attitude. She begins to move, then more and more. 
Finally, she jumps down, begins to dance with attitude. Aadoo has moved back, is 
looking at her, looks at Mahabir. Mahabir is looking at Veera, looks around, no threat, 
looks back at her. Veera is full out pumping the dance, it has been a while for her. She 
turns to look at Mahabir, entranced by the attitude, connects with him without 
breaking the act. He looks at her. He sees her. She is different from him. He turns 
casually to the tempo engine, does his check up and stuff. She turns to look at Aadoo. 
Aadoo begins to move his head, looks at Mahabir, continues to move his head. Then 
with a large paintra jumps forward – Hadippa. He begins to do bhangra steps to the 
western music. She continues to dance with western attitude without breaking. He 
does full baisakhi bhangra. Mahabir moves behind the tempo, stands leaning his back 
on it, in thought.

They come up to Aadoo who is at the driver’s seat. Mahabir gives Aadoo the keys.

Then he looks at her deliberately as they walk up. The tempo is seen turning around 
and driving away behind them.

feels the thrill of heartbeat. He looks at her for a long time, looks as though he is

Mari jindagi khatam ae kuch na ho sake ae, theek na ho sake, bas mar

He looks at her, then grabs her arm and starts walking her to the police station. 
She grunts in anger, resists with all her strength.  
Veera

Then he turns and walks towards the police station. She looks at him go. There 
is a constable standing outside the police station.  
Veera  
Mahabir, ruko... 
Then she goes behind him.  
Veera  
Kya bachpana hai...?  
He begins to walk faster. She runs, reaches and grabs him. 
Veera  
Paagal ho gaye ho...?  

He grabs her and moves in the same flow towards the police station as the 
constable watches, then pushes her close to the constable and quickly turns and runs 
back leaving Veera confounded.  
The constable is looking at her, greatly intrigued.  
Mahabir crosses the lane, hurries down as his heart beats, as he feels a melting

Veera is standing in front of the police constable, blank.

Veera opens her eyes, a rush of various thoughts in her brain. The other

Mahabir comes up the moving bus.  
She sees him, he sees her. She relaxes.  
He walks up the aisle without looking at her. They are pretending that they do 
not know each other.  
He comes and stands next to her.  
She closes her eyes. Then she moves her knee to touch him.  
He controls his reaction, looks away.  
She sits there, feeling comfort in the touch. 
He stands there, confused in the warmth that he is feeling.  
They have no place together. They are together only as long as the journey 
lasts.  
 
They are sitting on different seats in the bus. Not looking but connected.

Thoda aur time – tumhaare saath... (pause) Maine kabhi aisa kabhi feel 
nahin kiya hai na... ki main jo chaahe kar sakti hoon, jaise chaahe reh 
sakti hoon... kyonki tum samhaal loge. Maine kabhi aisa feel nahin 
kiya hai. (pause) Magar tum phans jaoge... Pehle vo soch rahe the ki 
hum shayad Calcutta mein hain. Ab unhein pata chal jayega hum is 
area mein hain. Ab koi chance nahin hai bachne ka, hai na? Haan...?  
Mahabir 
Hmm...  
Veera  
Shit yaar... Sab kharaab ho gaya.  
She closes her eyes, faces down. Then she looks back at him maturely.  
Veera  
Kya karein? Bolo...  
They are looking at each other.  
Mahabir 
Mera khayaal oopar chalte hain  
She looks at him for a moment, then –  
Veera  
Haan...?  
Mahabir 
Chhat par... Chalegi...?  
She feels a thrill, giggles, but then gets quickly anxious again.  
Veera  
Magar hum aage...  
Mahabir 
Kitta baat karegi...? Chal  
She giggles in excitement. Then follows him up the iron stairs to the roof. 
They tip-toe as he leads her forward. Then sit in front of a tarpauline which covers 
some luggage. A jolt as the bus starts, she giggles again.

He lowers to lie down again.

She slides up, reaches his toes, slides up, he adjusts, she slides up to his chest, 
slides up and puts her head in line with his.  
Veera  
Hmm... Ab koi takleef nahin ho rahi.  
He does not react, is awkward.

He is uneasy.

He opens his bag and takes out the gun, gives it to her. She comes to a forward 
posture, looking at the gun with awe and takes it in both her hands.  
Veera

Then she makes to aim at something.  
Mahabir 
Ho gaya? Vaapas de.

Veera  
Dhichkyon, dhichkyon...

Haan theek hai de de.

She drinks the water, wipes her mouth. He makes sure the water is wiped. She 
looks at him. He touches her head with his palm. She melts.

He climbs up a mound, pulls her up. They look down. He seems pleased by 
what he is looking at. She looks too.  
Down in the valley is a large flock of nomadic shepherds with their live-stock, 
crossing through the snow.  
He looks at her, moves ahead. She follows. They move down towards the

Veera has kept two plates on a mat on the settee. Excitement is ticking in her

He walks out of the door. He tries to control himself, but knows that a surge of 
tears is coming. He strides up to a basin of water, sits holding it, trying to control 
himself. He can not. He splashes water on his face. He fights with the crying, splashes 
water again, wipes his face. Manages a straight face. He gets up. 
The door opens and Mahabir comes in, looking down. He looks up.  
Veera has lit a candle at the food spread. With great fondness she is placing a 
cushion as a seat for Mahabir. Mahabir goes out before she can see him.  
He comes against the pillar, trying to control himself again, but Veera comes 
out after a moment. He looks at her, looks away. She quickly hugs him from behind. 
He breaks down, begins to weep.  
Veera  
Nahin nahin... Kuch nahin...

smiles, follows her. 
Veera sits on a rock, looking into the mountains. Breeze is blowing her hair, 
she is free. She is humming a tune. Mahabir is walking up to her. She turns to look at 
him again, turns back, continues to hum.  
After a moment, there is a cracking sound across the valley. She is surprised. 
It sounded like a thunderbolt. She looks to the side, then turns back to look.  
Mahabir is holding his waist, lowering to the ground in the middle of the 
clearing.  
Veera looks at him in question.  
He is turning around to look behind.  
Another cracking sound, the second bullet hits Mahabir and he falls to the 
ground.  
Veera is looking.  
Behind Mahabir she sees rows of police and paramilitary soldiers running in 
from various sides. Scores of them, all pointing guns towards Mahabir.

She gets off the rock, bounds towards Mahabir.  
Veera  
Heyy... 
 
The forces are charging towards Mahabir from three sides.  
Veera runs towards Mahabir as he falls to the ground. The lullaby echoes in 
the beautiful valley. Veera is waving her arms to the policemen, rushing in.  
She reaches Mahabir screaming, covers him protectively, breathing hard with 
her mouth open. He is going senseless.  
Veera

He tries to push her away from himself. She falters, grabs him back. He is 
trying to push her again.

screaming like a wounded tigress. 
Veera  
(scream) Khabardaar... 
She looks back at Mahabir.  
Veera  
(scream) Mahabir... Mahabir... 
He is mumbling something, senslessly.  
Veera 
(trying to listen) Haan...? Haan...? Sab theek ho jayega... sab theek ho 
jayega... 
The ACP Special Cell moves forward, looks at her.  
ACP 
 
Veera Tripathy? 
Veera 
(screams) Goli kyon chalayee you bastards...? Goli kyon chalayee...? 
Kya kar raha tha ye...?  
The ACP looks back at the force. The men seem confused. This was not what 
they were briefed. The ACP moves forward –  
ACP 
 
Veera suno... 
Veera  
Peeche... peeche... Maar daaloongi main...  
She turns to Mahabir, keeps screaming to revive him. The ACP indicates 
secretly to the other officer. The formation moves sleathily to circle Veera. The ACP 
speaks to Veera –  
ACP 
 
Isko hopital le jaana chahiye 

 
 
Veera 
(scream) Shoot kyon kiya? Haan...? Main chhodoongi nahin... Peeche 
hato... 
ACP 
Dekho time nahin hai. Isko hospital le jaana hoga varna ye mar 
jayega....  
Veera  
(scream) Nahin... Kuch nahin hoga...  
ACP 
 
Jaldi le jaate hain isey 
Veera  
(impatient) Haan, hospital le chalo... Jaldi...  
 
The ACP turns and calls the medics. 
ACP 
 
Bulao, bulao...  
Veera  
(trying to revive) Mahabir... Mahabir...

Medics carrying the stretcher through the village path. Villagers watch. 
Mahabir is on the stretcher – motionless.   
Veera is holding the stretcher close to Mahabir’s face, clambering along, 
speaking to him.  
Veera  
Suno... suno Mahabir...  
There is no reaction from him.  
Veera  
Main tumhein gaon le jaoongi, theek hai? Promise... Amma ke paas...  
The ACP and the medics look at Mahabir, look at Veera.  
Veera 
Maine kaha tha na sab achcha hoga...? Kaha tha na...? Kuch nahin hua, 
sab theek hai... Main bol rahi hoon na... Tum dekhna...

Hospital Cabin 
 
The door opens and Veera looks up in anticipation. She is sitting on the cot. 
It’s been many hours that she is sitting like a rock, the stains of Mahabir’s blood still 
on her firan. She sees someone, then turns her eyes away in bitter disappoinment.  
It’s her father. And mother. Two others emerge from the curtain. They are 
looking at her, moving to her.  
She is sitting, looking the other way.  
Mother 
Veera... 
Veera does not respond. They move to her slowly. Suddenly Veera turns to 
them and stands –  
Veera 
Dekhiye... main jaanti hoon aap kya soch rahe hain... magar baat kya 
hai, aap nahin jaante... Anyway, the important thing is that Mahabir ko 
bachaana hai... Usey bachaana hai papa, okay...? Mujhe kidnap kiya... 
haan... Magar baat vo nahin hai... baat ulti hai...  
Mother 
Kya ho gaya meri bachchi...? 
Veera 
(irritation) Arey kuch nahin hua hai... (plain) Kuch nahin hua, main 
bataoongi...  
Father looks at a doctor who has come with him, doctor moves to her.  
Doctor  
Veera...  
Veera  
(instinctive) Ye kaun hai? Ye kaun hai...?  
Doctor  
Baitho, baith jao...  
She gets it, sniggers.  
Veera  
Aap log kya soch rahe hain? Haan...? Mujhe kuch nahin hua hai...  
The doctor has indicated the nurse and the others to hold her. They move close 
to hold her.  
Veera  
Ye kya ho raha hai...? 
They grab her.  
Veera  
Arey... arey....? Chhodo..., chhodo mujhe... Arey....?  
It becomes a struggle.  
Veera  
(screams) Papa... 

 
 
Doctor  
(to Tripathy) Aap bhi... 
Tripathy holds her as well, tries to calm her down. Veera sees that a nurse is 
filling an injection syringe.  
Veera  
(sharp) Ye injection kis ke liye? (scream) Ruko, ruko... Let me go...  
She struggles, they turn her to her side and hold her down as she shouts –  
Veera  
Papa please, meri baat suniye...  
Tripathy 
Sh.. sh.. sh.. 
The doctor pulls her shalwaar down, proceeds to disinfect her skin.  
Veera  
(scream) Arey stop it...  
Then she begins to negotiate –  
Veera 
Achcha ek second, ek second... ek second rukiye... kuch baat hai, 
rukiye to... ek second, dekhiye... mujhe... nahin, dekhiye... baat 
suniye... Arey... ek second...  
Doctor  
Bas bas bas...  
The needle is pierced and the plunger is pressed. The doctor is holding cotton-
wool to the point.  
Veera  
(scream) Baat samajh nahin aati? Ye kya kiya...? Abhi mujhe... Main...  
Doctor  
Shhh... Ab aap so jao. Theek hai?  
Tripathy 
Sleep Veera... You are exhausted. You have to sleep, okay?  
The drug begins to have influence on her. 
Veera  
I don’t have to... No...  
Flash. Mountains. Mahabir in the distance.  
Veera  
There is... No... 
Flash. Stream, forest. Mahabir walking away.  
Veera’s mind goes away.

Mr. Tripathy walks out to the corridor from the room, moves to the 
Commisioner of Police, Delhi, who is talking to the ACP Special Cell and the area 
SP.  
ACP 
Spot death thi sir. Around nine-fifteen. Stretcher par daalne ke pehle hi 
mar chuka tha.  
Tripathy 
Kamal...  
The Comissioner turns swiftly to him.  
Tripathy 
Veera ko abhi Delhi move kar sakte hain?  
CoP 
 
Sure...  
Mr. Tripathy nods, walks back inside.  
CoP 
 
Body kahan hai? 
Music begins, we begin to move back, down the corridor, away from the 
policemen as they talk.  
SP 
 
Mortuary mein hai sir...

The Recovery 
 
[A] The white stripes running on the black road at night.  
Inside, Veera is lying asleep on a cot. A nurse attends to her. She opens her 
eyes in the dark, looks around, can not comprehend what is happening.  
 
 
[B] Veera jittering violently. She is in her senses but her mind is swimming. 
Veera’s room in Tripathy House at night. The nurse gets up from her feet and rushes 
to her head. An old governess rushes in.  
Nurse  
Aap idhar aao, main injection ready karti hoon.

Mother 
Taaki unhein lage sab theek hai, normal hai...  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
[F] Vinay’s mother and gaudy sister and sitting around Veera’s bed.  
Gaudy 
Dad was saying we can have the wedding in some other city and I said 
Ammmazzing... I think we can all...  
Vinay’s Mom (scrutinizingly) Tumhaara kya khayaal hai Veera...? 
 
Veera is looking at her.  
Vinay’s Mom Wedding kis sheher mein honi chahiye...? 
 
 
 
Veera  
Jee...

Tripathy House 
 
Merry gathering in the hall post dinner.  
Shukla 
Achcha... har winter mein kehte hain bahot sardi pad rahi hai... aur har 
summer mein kehte hain o my god it’s too hot...  
Gaudy  
Correct correct 
Shukla  
Why is it always a surprise...? Har saal...? Kamaal hai...  
 
Meanwhile, Veera has appeared at the staircase in the distance. Now her 
mother sees her and rushes forward. 
Mother 
Arey... Kya hua...?  
 
Everyone stops and looks.  
Mother 
Aap neeche kyon aa rahi hain? Where is the nurse...? 
 
Mother reaches Veera, Veera continues to climb down.  
Tripathy 
Let her come. Aa jao beta... 
 
Mother supports Veera as she climbs down, still weak.  
In the hall there are many others. Vinay and his family are there too. Everyone 
look towards her.  
 
Veera reaches a sofa.  
Shukla  
Good. Aaiye, baithiye...  
Veera is made to sit on the sofa.  
Shukla  
How are you feeling now...?  
Veera  
(weak) Better...  
 
Veera looks around slowly.  
Veera  
Aap sab kaise hain...?  
 
Veera hears Vinay’s sister titter.  
Shukla Jr 
(OC) Hum to theek hain...  
 
Vinay’s mom (OC) Bus aapke baare mein thoda worried thhe ki aapki tabiyat theek 
ho jaaye 
Veera  
Hmm... 

 
 
Shukla  
(OC) Pehle se bahot behtar lag rahi hai Manu...  
Everyone is looking at Veera.  
Veera turns to Vinay.  
Veera  
Hi Vinay... 
 
Everyone smiles, a pleasant hum in the room. They watch intently.  
Vinay  
Hi Veera... 
Veera  
Pahaad ke oopar... ghar mil gaya mujhe...  
Vinay  
(OC) Really...? 
Veera 
Banaya maine khaana... apne ghar ki safai bhi kee... Phir goli chal 
gayee... 
Veera’s mother tries to change the topic –  
Mother 
Vinay ko mountains bahot pasand hain na...? Austria mein vo kaun sa 
resort hai Veera ka favourite...? 
Priya  
The ski resort...?  
Veera 
(continuing her drift) Main hamesha kehti thi na... ki main bhaag 
jaaongi yahan se, mujhe sheher mein nahin rehna...? Sab kehte hain, 
bhaagta koi nahin hai. Main bhi nahin jaati... Agar Mahabir mujhe 
kidnap kar ke na le gayaa hota. Magar ab na... main ja chuki hoon. Ab 
main vaapas nahin aa sakti. 
Mr. Tripathy sits up.  
Tripathy 
I think tumhein aaraam karna chahiye Veera. We will talk later.  
Veera 
(unaffected) Ajeeb baat hai... Kidnap ho gayee... par vahan azaad thi... 
Aur yahan... jail mein...  
Tripathy 
Arey... (snigger) Anyway, Pratima...  
Mother 
(coming forward) Chalo Veera... 
 Veera  
(disregarding) Ye ghar hai mera...?  
 
She looks at the elderly gentleman as she is made to stand. Her mother 
notices.  
Mother 
Come... 
Veera  
Aaj chocolate nahin laaye Shukla tayaji...?  
Shukla  
(smile) Abhi mangwa kar deta hoon...  

 
 
Veera  
Kahan?  
Shukla  
Hmm...?  
Veera  
Kahan denge? Yahan, ya bathroom mein...?   
Shukla looks at her.  
Veera  
Haan...?  
Mother 
(undercurrent) Veera, chup...  
 
Veera turns to her. 
Veera  
(aloud) Jee mummy...? Kuch kehna hai...?  
Mother becomes uncomfortable, looks at Tripathy, Tripathy is looking at her, 
at Shukla. Shukla shrugs. 
Shukla  
Hunh... Strange... Ahem... 
Veera looks at Shukla.  
Veera 
Yaad nahin aa raha hai...? Main yaad karati hoon – Meri princess... 
Duniya ki sabse khoobsurat ladki hai meri bachchi... Yaad aaya...? 
Apne haath se mera munh daba kar band kar dete the... haan...? taaki 
meri cheekh baahar na nikle... haan...? Jo main chillati thi... Jo main us 
pain mein cheekhti thi vo cheekh baahar na nikle koi sun na le isliye 
zor se mera munh daba dete the Shh... Shh...  
Shukla  
(simultaneously) Arey... arey...  
Tripathy 
Whaa... 
 
Shukla’s son stares at his father, at Veera.  
Shukla  
By god... 
Mother 
Priya hold her please... 
 
Mother and her sister Priya make to turn Veera away. 
Shukla  
Sach mein paagal ho gayee hai ye... Sahi keh rahe hain sab... 
Veera               (continues) Bathroom mein... baar baar... nal chala kar...  
Mother 
(scolding nurse) Kahan chali gayee thi tum haan...?  
 
The nurse turns Veera, mother and she begin to pull her away now.  
Nurse  
Aaiye, aaiye... 
 

 
 
Veera 
Cheekhti thi... nau saal ki thi... cheekhti thi... magar vo haath munh ke 
oopar, dab gayee cheekh, kisi ne nahin suni...  
Mother 
Chalo... Le chalo...  
Shukla 
Mad... she has gone mad... Ask her to shut up... Manu ask her to shut 
her mouth or else...  
Veera  
(screams) Shut up... Aaaaaa... Aaaaaa... 
 
Everyone hears her scream. 
She stares defiantly at Shukla. Shukla turns and strides out of the room, 
followed by his son.  
Silence.  
Tripathy looks at her daughter. Veera turns to him.  
Veera 
Yaa, aisa to hota hai... Aisa to hota rehta hai...To kya hai na... I am not 
okay with it. Ye duniya... jahan aisa hota rehta hai... jahan kya sach 
hai, kya jhoot hai... sab mila hua hai... Bahot confusion hai yahan...  
Tripathy 
Veera... Baby... Okay, lets be sensible about this...  
Veera 
(loud) No... I won’t be sensible... I’ll be stupid... I am stupid...  
Tripathy 
Relax baby... 
Veera 
Sensible...? Veera baahar jao to careful rehna... Ghar ke baahar bahot 
bure log hote hain, ladki to hamesha careful rehna chahiye...? To ye 
kyon nahin kaha ki mujhe ghar ke andar bhi careful rehna hai, mujhe 
aap logon se bhi bach ke rehna hai...? Ye kyon nahin kaha...? Yahan to 
main bilkul exposed thi... Ghar mein thi main... To mujhe nahin hona 
hai sensible. Main bewakoof hoon... Main kharaab hoon... Magar main 
aap logon mein se ek nahin hoon. Main vaapas nahin aaoongi...  
Music begins. Everyone sits silently.  
Veera stands for a moment, tears dripping from her eyes, then she turns and 
walks. Lyrics of the song begin. She walks away from everyone.

Song # 6 {Heera} 
 
Tripathy’s bungalow in the day.  
 
Veera sits in a car as the family watches. She slides to the other side.  
The car drives out of the bungalow.  
The highway. The car driving on the highway. Veera looking in front. She 
asks the driver to stop the car. The car pulls over.  
Veera walks to the side, breaking down. She cries her heart out. She drops to 
her knees, taking Mahabir’s name, letting it out, finally letting him go.  
 
The highway rolls in the day. The landscape runs on both sides, in different 
speeds.  
 
Cherries drop into the water. It is a cottage industry plant, making fruit 
preserve. Small assembly of churners, conveyors, many cans. Veera supervising the 
process, noting numbers in a register.  
 
Next to the factory, on a hill – a small concrete house. Veera is seen walking 
out in the evening. She is standing outside her house in the fading light. Her hair is 
blowing softly in the breeze, she is breathing the mountain air. The journey has 
changed, the light has changed. She has changed too. She is looks into the distance, at 
the grass field.  
Two kids are playing together in the field. A boy and a girl. This is the girl 
who we have seen collecting flowers earlier, and the boy who we have seen getting 
slapped and restrained. Now they are playing together.  
Veera looks at them, smiles.  
The kids are looking for something in the grass, the boy passes something he 
has found to the girl. Then they run away together.  
Veera is looking at them, smiling from her heart. Fade out.
