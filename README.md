# Bollywood Gender Stereotype Analysis Project

This project identifies and quantifies gender stereotypes in Bollywood movies using both textual (scripts) and visual (trailers) content, applying NLP techniques, gender lexicons, and emotion/screen time/music bias metrics. It also offers automated rewrites and feedback for filmmakers.

## Objectives

## Objectives

1. **Detect Gender Bias** from both **scripts** and **trailers**.
2. **Quantify Bias** at character, movie, and decade levels.
3. Use **linguistic lexicons** and **centrality metrics** to surface gender-based stereotype patterns.
4. **Visualize Bias** through emotion, screen time, and song allocation analysis.
5. Provide a **Bias Feedback Report** for writers and directors.
6. Rewrite biased scripts automatically using LLM prompts.

## Features Implemented

| Subtask                     | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| **1. Data Cleaning**             | Preprocessed movie scripts (POS tagging, coreference resolution) |
| **2. Character Matching** | Characters matched using cast-gender and mention-centrality files |
| **3.Lexicon Tagging**            | Matched verbs/adjectives/roles from male/female lexicons |
| **4. Dependency Parsing** | Extract subject-verb-object patterns to analyze traits linked to gender |
| **5. Screen Time Analysis** | From `complete-data.csv` |
| **6. Emotion Bias** | Plotted emotion distributions by gender |
| **7. Music Bias** | Compared male/female singers using `songsDB.csv` and `songsFrequency.csv` |
| **8. Plot Mentions** | Used `coref_plot.csv` and plot-based mentions |
| **9. Centrality** | Used mentions and centrality to highlight imbalance |
| **10.SVO Pattern Analysis**       | Analyzed subject-verb-object patterns to spot stereotype framing |
| **11.Bias Feedback Report**       | Detailed report on bias types across all movies |
| **12.Script Rewriting**           | Removed bias and rewrote scenes using LLM prompts |
| **13.Sentence Mapping**           | Stored original-biased vs. rewritten sentences |
| **14. Final Output** | Summarized bias in scripts and stored them in summarizer folder for each movie and provided rewrites for each file in rewrite folder |

## Sample Output Files

- `bias_reports/*.csv` – Bias types (verb/adjective/role) with gender and line info
- `rewrites/*.txt` – Rewritten bias-free scripts
- `summaries/*.txt` – Summary of biases and suggestions
- `Bias_Feedback_Report/final_bias_feedback.csv` – One-page report per film

## ▶ How to Run

1. **Clone the repo**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Bollywood-Data-Project.git
cd Bollywood-Data-Project
```

2. **Install dependencies**:

 **Text Processing & NLP**
spacy – for sentence segmentation, dependency parsing, NER

nltk – for optional tokenization, stopwords, or lexicons

coreferee – for coreference resolution (if used)

pandas – for data handling (CSV, DataFrames, etc.)

numpy – for numerical computations (optional but common)

openai – to generate rewrites and summaries via GPT

re – built-in Python regex module for pattern matching

**Visualization**
matplotlib – for plots (e.g., centrality, emotion bias)

seaborn – advanced plots (if used)

**Utilities**
os – for file path and directory handling (built-in)

glob – to read multiple .txt files in folders (built-in)

tqdm – for progress bars while looping through files

collections – e.g., Counter, defaultdict (built-in)


3. **Clean the data**:
```bash
jupyter notebook Bollywood-Data-Master/data_cleaning.ipynb
```
4. **Run analysis notebook**:
```bash
jupyter notebook Bollywood-Data-Master/main.ipynb
```
This notebook provides visual insights on:
Centrality, emotion, screen time, and song bias
Lexicon analysis

5.**Detect Bias and Generate rewrites**:
```bash
jupyter notebook sample_seteryotype model.ipynb
```

##  Bias Sentence Mapping File

A `.csv` file is generated mapping:
- `original_sentence`
- `bias_type`
- `gender`
- `rewritten_sentence`
This can be used by scriptwriters to review and selectively accept rewrites.

---

##  Visualizations

- Boxplots for **Character Centrality by Gender**
- Bar charts of **Emotion Distribution in Trailers**
- Line graphs showing **Screen Time Trends by Gender**
- Heatmaps of **Adjective/Verb Usage Patterns**
- Gender Split of **Songs Per Film**
